[Tower](Tower "wikilink")\]\] The MAX Crash is an armored-infantry-based
rapid-ingress assault tactic.

A large group of soldiers wearing [MAX](MAX "wikilink") suits charges a
[Facility](Facility "wikilink"), usually the [Back
Door](Back_Door "wikilink"), and attempts to breach defenses in Auto-run
mode.

Usually this requires a significant group, as the MAXes are unable to
open locked [IFF](IFF "wikilink") panels or fire their weapons in
auto-run mode.
