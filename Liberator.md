**Liberator**

The Liberator bomber, often called simply a "Lib" or "Libby," is crewed
by three soldiers: the pilot, the bombardier, and the tailgunner.

The pilot has a 35mm cannon that may be suitable for attacking ground
targets, and the tailgunner possesses a pivoting 25mm machine gun that
is normally used to fend off aerial attacks from the rear. The gun
however is positioned such that the tail of the craft restricts its
vertical arc of fire considerably.

The bombardier is capable of firing payloads of two different bomb
types: the tankbuster, which travels to the surface as a single bomb and
creates a fairly concentrated zone of damage that is suitable for
damaging vehicular targets, and the cluster bomb, which separates into
nine smaller 'bomblets' at a predetermined altitude, creating a larger
zone of damage suitable for attacking groups of infantry.

However, the bombardier may only launch bombs when the Liberator is
flying level and at a safe altitude.

A skilled bombardier may be capable of landing an entire magazine of ten
bombs on a single point, depending on flight trajectory. By slewing his
or her view forward or aft, the release path of the bombs is altered.

The Liberator requires a [Technology Plant](Technology_Plant "wikilink")
lattice link or [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") vehicle pad in order
to be purchasable.
