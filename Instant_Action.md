The **Instant Action** command allows a player to be spawned directly
into combat from anywhere in the game.

The location a soldier is sent to is partly determined by the number and
frequency of [Hotspots](Hotspot "wikilink") on the various
[Planet](Planet "wikilink") maps, along with friendly population already
in place, along with [Empire Lock](Empire_Lock "wikilink") and
[Population lock](Population_lock "wikilink").

To use Instant Action, either type '/ia' or '/instantaction' into the
chat box, or press Esc and select from the menu.

As with [Recall](Recall "wikilink"), location affects timer:

-   Friendly [SOI](SOI "wikilink"): 10 seconds
-   Neutral SOI or open country: 20 seconds
-   Enemy SOI: 30 seconds

Activating Instant Action will turn off (but not uninitialize)
[implants](implant "wikilink") and deactivate cloak (if any). Moving,
jumping, cloaking or activating implants will all cancel the Instant
Action countdown.

Upon arrival, your [Personal Waypoint](Personal_Waypoint "wikilink")
will be reset to indicate the location of the
[Hotspot](Hotspot "wikilink") that you are meant to respond to.
