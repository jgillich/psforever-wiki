[Sony Online Entertainment](Sony_Online_Entertainment "wikilink") (SOE)
is a computer game development division of Sony which seems to
specialize in Massively Multiplayer Online Games. SOE is best known for
creating EverQuest, Star Wars Galaxies, and
[PlanetSide](PlanetSide "wikilink"), which all have thousands of
subscribers. SOE was originally Verant Interactive. __NOTOC__

## History

![](EverQuest_Box_Art.jpg "EverQuest_Box_Art.jpg")

### EverQuest

*EverQuest*, which is, by far, Sony Online Entertainment's most popular
game, was released on March 16th, 1999. *EverQuest* can be seen as Sony
Online Entertainment and Verant Interactive's start, as an internal Sony
division, Sony Interactive Studios America (SISA), which was formed in
1995, put John Smedley in charge of the development of a game that would
become *EverQuest*. Brad McQuaid and Steve Clover were hired as
programmers for *EverQuest*.

Sony Online Entertainment was born in April 1998 when Sony Online
Ventures with Sony Pictures Entertainment. SISA became 989 Studios, and
*EverQuest*, which was credited as being developed by 989 Studios and
published by SOE, entered beta at around this time. Most of 989 Studios
began to focus on PlayStation development, while the online division
spun off and, at first, became RedEye Interactive and then finally
becoming known as Verant Interactive.

*EverQuest* became immensely popular and gained ten expansion packs, a
sequel, and numerous spin off games.

### Star Wars Galaxies

In April of 2000, SOE hired Raph Koster and Rich Vogel from the Ultima
Online development team to develop a new game entitled *Star Wars
Galaxies*. This was a new foray into massively multiplayer online
gaming, combining a popular franchise into a massively multiplayer
setting. The game attempted to attract a large fanbase with a popular
franchise. SWG was released in 2003 and saw rapid growth to 300,000
subscribers but hasn't seen major growth since then. Star Wars Galaxies
has received two expansion packs, *Jump to Lightspeed* and *Rage of the
Wookies*. Currently the game is experiencing a major overhaul labled as
the NGE. SOE has decided to focus on a younger age group that lets you
take missions for heros and villians from the movies instead of building
your own cities and such like it was for the past 2 years.

### New Ideas

Sony Online Entertainment has taken several new leaps in Massively
Multiplayer Online gaming with the releases of
[PlanetSide](PlanetSide "wikilink") and *EverQuest Online Adventures*.
PlanetSide was one of the first massively multiplayer online first
person shooters, while *EverQuest Online Adventures* was one of the
first PS2 MMORPG's. Neither turned out to be as popular as SOE's other
MMO's, but SOE still maintains them regardless.

### Current State

Currently, John Smedley is the president of Sony Online Entertainment.
It is headquartered in San Diego, California with studios in Austin,
Texas and Seattle, Washington. Sony Online Entertainment released
*EverQuest II*, but it still maintains many of it's older games,
including the original *EverQuest* and
[PlanetSide](PlanetSide "wikilink").

On January 17, 2005, SOE announced it's new feature called Station
Publishing, which is a new label for distributing titles made by other
developers. The first games under this process are Turbine's Asheron's
Call: Throne of Destiny and Ahseron's Call: Throne of Destiny expansion
packs. SOE also makes more casually oriented games through Station.com,
including *Jeopardy! Online* and *Cosmic Rift*
