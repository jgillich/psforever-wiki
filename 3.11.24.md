Version 3.11.24 (July 11 2006)

**Update Highlights**

-   The [Wasp](Wasp "wikilink") will no longer be available without the
    [Air Cavalry Interceptor](Air_Cavalry_Interceptor "wikilink")
    [certification](certification "wikilink").
-   [Pounder](Pounder "wikilink") secondary firing mode projectiles now
    explode when they contact an object or when their 3 second timer
    expires; whichever comes first. This will bring the Pounder grenade
    functionality more inline with how all other grenade weapons
    currently work.
-   Added hack detection. We are currently only logging cheaters; once
    we are satisfied the detection is working correctly they will be
    punished.
