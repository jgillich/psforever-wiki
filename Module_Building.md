Module Buildings can be found in each of the 6 [Core
Combat](Core_Combat "wikilink") Caverns. There are 2 Module Buildings in
each cavern.

The Module Building features:

-   An [Ancient Control Console](Ancient_Control_Console "wikilink")
-   A [Spawn Room](Spawn_Room "wikilink")
-   [Ancient Equipment Terminals](Ancient_Equipment_Terminal "wikilink")
-   [Module Cradles](Module_Cradle "wikilink")
-   [Modules](Modules "wikilink")
-   [Teleporters](Teleporter "wikilink")

Module Buildings are the buildings were you can get
[Modules](Modules "wikilink") that give benefits for the surface
facilities after the [Module](Module "wikilink") has been installed in
the [Facility](Facility "wikilink")'s [Module
Cradle](Module_Cradle "wikilink"). Each module building spawns 2 modules
at a time, located in the module cradles near the two
[Teleporters](Teleporter "wikilink"). The modules availible at the
building rotate every 15 minutes and can be predicted by noting the cave
timer on the other caves on the [Interstellar
Map](Interstellar_Map "wikilink"). Both module buildings in each cave
have the same two modules available at any given time. In order to take
a module from the cradle, your [empire](empire "wikilink") must own the
building. For the module to be installed on the surface, it must first
be charged in the core beam in the [Core
Complex](Core_Complex "wikilink").

See [Modules](Modules "wikilink") for more information about their
Benefits.
