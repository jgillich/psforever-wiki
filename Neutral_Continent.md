A **Neutral Continent** (or Neutral Planet in the
[Post-Bending](The_Bending "wikilink") era) is simply a
[planet](planet "wikilink") which does not possesses a direct link to an
[Empire](Empire "wikilink")'s [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink").
Empire's must link to these planets from other continents to gain
access.

The Neural Continents are:

-   [Cyssor](Cyssor "wikilink")
-   [Ishundar](Ishundar "wikilink")
-   [Searhus](Searhus "wikilink")
-   [Oshur Battle Islands](Oshur "wikilink")

The words Planet and Continent are sometimes interchangable.
