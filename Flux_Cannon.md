This weapon is found on the roof of the [Thresher](Thresher "wikilink")
and [Leviathan](Leviathan "wikilink") and is controlled by the vehicle's
gunner.

The Thresher version is similar to the [Aurora](Aurora "wikilink")'s
[Flux Pod](Flux_Pod "wikilink"), both fire distinctive purple orbs of
energy which are very dangerous to infantry with their strong splash
damage.

The Leviathan version fires the projectiles at a much greater velocity,
but lacks the damage and splash effect of its Thresher counterpart.
