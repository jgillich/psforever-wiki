![](Respawn.jpg "fig:Respawn.jpg") At each [Sanctuary
Villa](Sanctuary_Villa "wikilink") are three [Respawn
Buildings](Respawn_Building "wikilink") placed close to the [HART
building](HART_building "wikilink"). These locations are where any
player spawns upon entering Sanctuary; from character creation, via
[Recall](Recall "wikilink"), exiting [VR
Training](VR_Training "wikilink"), or the unlikely event of death while
still in Sanctuary.

Inside each building are 6 [Respawn tubes](Respawn_tube "wikilink") and
several [Equipment terminals](Equipment_terminal "wikilink"). Along the
side of each building are also doors leading to the [VR
Training](VR_Training "wikilink") rooms. Most other Sanctuary services
can be found in the nearby [HART building](HART_building "wikilink").
