**Heavy Scout Rifle (HSR)**

[image:HSR-Icon.jpg](image:HSR-Icon.jpg "wikilink")

The **Heavy Scout Rifle**, commonly called the **HSR** was introduced in
May 2005 in patch [3.6.8](3.6.8 "wikilink"). The rifle fires the same
[Bolt](Bolt "wikilink") ammunition as the [Bolt
Driver](Bolt_Driver "wikilink") and has a 10 round magazine. The HSR
does far less damage than the Bolt Driver, but the 10 round clip, faster
[Cone of Fire](Cone_of_Fire "wikilink") recovery, and faster rate of
fire are advantages in some situations. The HSR also has a slightly
larger cone of fire than the Bolt Driver making it a little less
accurate at longer ranges.

The HSR is free for characters with the [Two Year Term of
Service](Term_of_Service "wikilink") [merit](merit "wikilink"). Others
may obtain it by purchasing the [Sniping](Sniping "wikilink")
[certification](certification "wikilink").
