[Damage Degradation](Damage_Degradation "wikilink") refers to the loss
of power of some weapons at increasing distance. For these weapons, your
shots will do less damage to the target as the distance increases, thus
to maximize your damage, get as close as possible with these weapons.
Most weapons don't start to have Damage Degradation until a certain
distance while others start to drop off in damage almost immediately.

The [Flail](Flail "wikilink") has _inverse_ Damage Degradation. It does
more damage at large distances and less damage at close distances.

Some weapons do not suffer Damage Degradation. Shotgun-type weapons do
not have Damage Degradation, yet their large [Cone of
Fire](Cone_of_Fire "wikilink") means that you are unlikely to land any
hits at large distances anyway. Many [vehicle](vehicle "wikilink") and
beam-type weapons do not have Damage Degradation either.

The following suffer from Damage Degradation:

- All [Standard Assault](Standard_Assault "wikilink") weaponry (except
  the [Mag-Scatter](Mag-Scatter "wikilink"))
- All [Medium Assault](Medium_Assault "wikilink") weaponry (except the
  [Spiker](Spiker "wikilink") and [Sweeper](Sweeper "wikilink"))
- [Lasher](Lasher "wikilink")
- [Mini-Chaingun](Mini-Chaingun "wikilink")
- [Orion](Orion "wikilink")
- [Avenger](Avenger "wikilink")
- All 12mm, 15mm, 20mm, 25mm, and 35mm [vehicle](vehicle "wikilink")
  weapons
- [Continuous Laser](Continuous_Laser "wikilink")
- [Anti-Tank Machine Gun](Anti-Tank_Machine_Gun "wikilink")
- [Rotary Chaingun](Rotary_Chaingun "wikilink")
- [Quasar](Quasar "wikilink")
- [Dual Cycler](Dual_Cycler "wikilink")
- [Flail](Flail "wikilink") (inverse Damage Degradation, see above)
- [Wall Turret](Wall_Turret "wikilink") (standard fire mode)
- [Spitfire](ACE#Spitfire "wikilink") and [Shadow
  Turrets](Shadow_Turret "wikilink")
