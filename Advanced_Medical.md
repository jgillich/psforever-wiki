**Advanced Medical**

If one of your allies has been killed and has not yet clicked the
"respawn" button, their body will remain on ground (once they respawn
their body becomes a [backpack](backpack "wikilink").) Simply point the
[Medical Applicator](Medical_Applicator "wikilink") at them and use it.
You will see a progress bar until they are revived. If the progress bar
dissapears during the process, **don't** let go, it is still reviving,
this is merely a bug.

Revived characters have full health, but zero
[Stamina](Stamina "wikilink") and deactivated
[Implants](Implant "wikilink").

This [Certification](Certification "wikilink") is required to obtain the
[Combat Resuscitation](Combat_Resuscitation "wikilink"), [Resuscitation
Medic](Resuscitation_Medic "wikilink"), and [Universal
Soldier](Universal_Soldier "wikilink") [Merit
Commendations](Merit_Commendation "wikilink").
