Version 3.9.6, released October 13, 2005.

### Combat Engineer Window

-   Added a Combat Engineer window for viewing deployables.
-   You can toggle the C.E. window by pressing Alt-E by default
    (remappable in the global keymap list of the Options page).
-   This window shows how many [Mines](ACE#Mine "wikilink"),
    [Boomers](ACE#Boomer "wikilink"), [Motion
    Sensors](ACE#Motion_Sensor "wikilink"), and [Spitfire
    Turrets](ACE#Spitfire_Turret "wikilink") the player has deployed,
    along with the deploy limits.

**[Rabbit](Rabbit "wikilink") Changes**

-   Added Rabbit sound preferences on the Sound Options page to allow
    players to disable the Rabbit ball drop, pickup, and reset sounds.

<!-- -->

-   Changed it so Rabbit ball carriers that are in
    [vehicles](vehicle "wikilink") that are destroyed by friendly fire
    are bailed unharmed from the vehicles instead of killed in the
    explosions.

<!-- -->

-   Made the Rabbit status window a bit transparent
