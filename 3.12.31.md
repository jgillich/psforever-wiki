        time.

        increased.

-   [Combat Engineers](Combat_Engineering "wikilink")
    -   There has been a recent breakthrough in engineering technology
        for players who are trained in [Advanced
        Engineering](Advanced_Engineering "wikilink") concepts! Combat
        Engineers now use [Armor Canisters](Armor_Canister "wikilink")
        more efficiently and will be able to repair
        [MAX](MAX "wikilink") units, equipment, and
        [vehicles](vehicles "wikilink") faster than players with the
        standard Engineering [certification](certification "wikilink").
        Repair speed is further increased for players with
        [Fortification](Fortification_Engineering "wikilink"),
        [Assault](Assault_Engineering "wikilink"), or Advanced
        Engineering. Infantry armor other than MAX armor will not be
        affected by this change.
