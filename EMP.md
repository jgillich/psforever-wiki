## EMP (ElectroMagnetic Pulse)

The EMP is a command ability that any soldier with [Command
Rank](Command_Rank "wikilink") 3 or higher can access using their
[Command Uplink Device (or CUD)](Command_Uplink_Device "wikilink"), the
range depends on the users Command Rank however.

-   Command Rank 3: 10 meter radius
-   Command Rank 4: 15 meter radius
-   Command Rank 5: 20 meter radius

An EMP can also be triggered by a charged [BFR](BFR "wikilink") [NTU
Siphon](NTU_Siphon "wikilink") and by the drivers of a
[Leviathan](Leviathan "wikilink"), [Juggernaut](Juggernaut "wikilink"),
or [Vindicator](Vindicator "wikilink").

Once triggered, this ability detonates a blast that doesn't harm
soldiers, but detonates [Mines](#High_Explosive_Mine "wikilink"),
[Boomers](#Remote-Detonated_Charge_(Boomer) "wikilink"), and disables
[Spitfire Turrets](ACE#Spitfire_Turret "wikilink"), [Shadow
Turrets](Shadow_Turret "wikilink"), [Cerberus
Turrets](Cerberus_Turret "wikilink"), [Wall
Turrets](Wall_Turret "wikilink") and [Motion
Sensors](ACE#Motion_Sensor_Alarm "wikilink"). It also disables all
[Implants](Implants "wikilink") and [Proximity
Maps](Proximity_Map "wikilink") of any enemy soldiers in the area, as
well as the weapons of all vehicles nearby, excluding
[BFRs](BFR "wikilink"), the Blast does damage the BFR systems however.

It is often utilized when clearing large fields of [Combat Engineering
(or CE)](Combat_Engineering "wikilink") whenever a force is attacking a
base, or a small team is commencing an insertion into an enemy base at a
heavily CE-ed entrance.

The recharge time for an EMP is 20 minutes.
