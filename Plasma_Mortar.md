**Plasma Mortar**

The Plasma Mortar is an indirect anti-infantry weapon. After the initial
explosive impact, the weapon leaves behind a plasma field for a
relatively long time. Anything stepping into the plasma field will take
minor armor damage. Soldiers wearing an [Infiltration
Suit](Infiltration_Suit "wikilink") when hit will be visible similar to
being hit by [Plasma grenades](Plasma_grenade "wikilink"). While the
initial explosive impact is not as great as the other [BFR
Anti-Infantry](BFR_Anti-Infantry "wikilink") gunner weapons, the
lingering plasma field can be used as an area control weapon. The weapon
is also great at causing multiple system damages to enemy
[BFRs](BFR "wikilink") with no shields.
