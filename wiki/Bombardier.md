The Bombardier is the member of a combat aircraft crew who operates the
bombsight and drops the bombs.

Both the [Liberator](Liberator "wikilink") and the
[Vulture](Vulture "wikilink") bombers each have one bombardier seat in
the middle of the aircraft.

The mount-points for this seat are just ahead of the wings on either
side, marked as gunner seats.

The bombardier's normal view mode when airborne is a downward-facing
bomb-scope, which shows a predicted impact reticle based on flight
trajectory and bomb type. The bombardier is also able to make small
adjustments to the bombs' trajectories by adjusting the drop reticle
forward and backward along the ground track of the aircraft. Using this
technique, skilled bombardiers can land an entire magazine on a single
point.

In the [Liberator](Liberator "wikilink"), the bombardier has a secondary
view mode, "bomber mode," allows him or her to swivel the camera in all
directions below the aircraft for observation, but munitions cannot be
dropped in this mode. The Vulture lacks this secondary mode.
