  deconstructs.

  person](Third_person.md) view.
- Secondary fire mode on the [Maelstrom](Maelstrom.md) will
  now cause damage to vehicles.
- [Galaxies](Galaxy.md) may no longer enter [Core
  Combat](Core_Combat.md) [Caverns](Caverns.md)
  through the [Geowarps](Geowarp.md).
- Router telepads cannot be deployed unless the Router is deployed.
- Router telepads will now disappear if the Router they are connected
  to is jacked.
- The [Flail](Flail.md) and [Ancient
  Turret](Ancient_Sentry_Turret.md) reticules will now display
  the [Ancient Tech](Ancient_Tech.md) reticule properly.

  [Deployables](ACE.md) can no longer be placed in doorways.

- The Flail's ammo capacitor now holds 50 shots and its armor has been
  reduced.
- The down angle on the Flail's turret has been decreased so there is
  now a large "under the guns" radius around it and infantry should
