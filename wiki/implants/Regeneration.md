The **Regeneration** [implant](Implants.md) allows a soldier to heal 1 point of
[Health](../terminology/Health.md) at the expense of 2 points of
[Stamina](../terminology/Stamina.md) per second. Once activated, the implant
continues to function until either all Health is restored, Stamina runs out, or
it is switched off. Using Regeneration will **not** restart the hacking sequence
if used while hacking (unlike [MedKits](../items/MedKit.md) or someone healing
you using the [Medical Applicator](../weapons/Medical_Applicator.md)).

Regeneration is represented on the [HUD](../etc/Heads-up_Display.md) as a
heart-shaped icon.
