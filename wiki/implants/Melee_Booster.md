The **Melee Booster** implant greatly increases damage output from all melee
weapons, which includes the [empire](../terminology/Empire.md)-specific combat
knife (key '5') standard to all infantry (Non-MAX)
[armor](../armor/Armor_Index.md), as well as the
[Fusion Blade](../weapons/Fusion_Blade.md).

Damage to enemy health points is increased by 25 over that of an unboosted knife
swing, resulting in death in 2 swings (Full health, no
[Personal Shield](Personal_Shield.md) implant) if combined with an
empire-specific combat knife's secondary mode.

Typically only used by [Infiltrators](../items/Infiltration_Suit.md), few other
players can get close enough to an enemy for this to be very useful. This
implant has no effect on any other weapon system.

It will use 10 stamina points for a swing in either swing mode for any melee
weapon.
