# Implants

Implants are cybernetic devices that are installed into various points, or
**Implant Slots**, of a soldier's body. These devices enhance a soldier's
abilities to super-human levels in speed, strength, the senses, stealth,
healing, or battlefield awareness depending on the implant chosen.

Your character can earn up to a maximum amount of three Implant Slots through
gaining [Battle Ranks](../terminology/Battle_Rank.md).

- BR6 - First slot
- BR12 - Second slot
- BR18 - Third slot

Once a slot has been earned, the actual Implant in it may be changed as often as
needed; unlike [Certifications](../certifications/Certification.md), there is no
change-over timer. The only limitation is access to an
[Implant Terminal](../items/Implant_Terminal.md).

Upon installation, Implants require a brief enabling time, known as the
[Initialization timer](../items/Initialization_timer.md). Once enabled you may
switch the implant on and off as needed. When activated, implants can quickly
use up your [stamina](../terminology/Stamina.md), leaving you drained and unable
to run, so caution is advised. Running out of stamina will also cause all
implants to turn off, although they can be immediately reactivated once stamina
returns to 20 or more points.

Enemy [Electro-magnetic Pulse (EMP)](../terminology/EMP.md) blasts and
[Jammer grenades](../weapons/Jammer_Grenade.md) will deactive all implants,
forcing them to reset their timers before they can enable and be activated
again.

Implants are installed at [Implant Terminals](../items/Implant_Terminal.md),
located in the [HART building](../locations/HART_building.md) of your
[Empire](../terminology/Empire.md)'s [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md), and
in [Bio Laboratories](../locations/Bio_Laboratory.md).

| [Regeneration](Regeneration.md) | ![](../images/Regeneration.gif "../images/Regeneration.gif") | for every 1hp: 2sp (running) - 1.5sp(standing) - 1sp (crouched) | 02:00 |
| [Second Wind](Second_Wind.md) | ![](../images/Second_wind.gif "../images/Second_wind.gif") | None; Adds 25sp when activated | 03:10 |
| [Sensor Shield](Sensor_Shield.md) | ![](../images/Sensor_shield.gif "../images/Sensor_shield.gif") | 1sp/sec (Cloak) - 3sp/sec (Std.) 3sp/sec (Agile) - 3sp/sec (Rexo) | 01:30 |
| [Surge](Surge.md) | ![](../images/Surge.gif "../images/Surge.gif") | 1sp/sec (Cloak) - 1sp/sec (Std.) 2sp/sec (Agile) - 3sp/sec (Rexo) | 01:30 |

sp = Stamina Points

Note that you regain 1sp/sec while standing and 2sp/sec while crouched, though
the use of the regeneration implant is a special case (see above).
