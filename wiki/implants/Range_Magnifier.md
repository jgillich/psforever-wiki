# Range Magnifier

The **Range Magnifier** Implant provides a weapon-independent zoom capability of
x4, x8 and x12 magnification. The zoom function becomes independent of any
unholstered weapon, allowing a soldier to stay zoomed when normally the function
would be turned off, such as during reloading, driving a
[vehicle](../vehicles/index.md), and gunning.

The x12 zoom option is more powerful than the standard zoom attached to most
weapons, including the [Bolt Driver](../weapons/Bolt_Driver.md), which stops at
x8. The exception is the [Scorpion](../weapons/Scorpion.md), which has a x12
magnification by default.

Primarily used by Snipers, in conjunction with the
[Bolt Driver](../weapons/Bolt_Driver.md), this implant can offer increased
accuracy. However, the usefulness of x12 magnification is debatable, given the
dynamic way in which maximum render distance is determined by the game, and the
added difficulty that micromanaging the independent zoom can entail.
