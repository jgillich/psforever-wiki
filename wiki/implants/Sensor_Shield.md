[Sensor Shield](Sensor_Shield.md), originally known as **Silent Run**, protects
the user from any sort of sensing devices, including:

- [Motion Alarm Sensors](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md)
- [Spitfire Turrets](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md)
- [Shadow Turrets](../weapons/Shadow_Turret.md)
- [Mosquito](../vehicles/Mosquito.md) radar
- [Interlink Facility](../locations/Interlink.md) benefits
- [Audio Amplifier](Audio_Amplifier.md)

[MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) units cannot use Sensor Shield.

Sensor Shield will also prevent damage from the low level
[Pain Fields](../terminology/Pain_Field.md) that exist in all base spawn rooms.
It does not protect against an installed [Pain Module](../etc/Pain_Module.md)
though.

For [infiltrators](../certifications/Infiltration_Suit_(Certification).md),
the Sensor Shield will remain on indefinitely inside a pain field as long you
stay in one position. The Sensor Shield will eventually run out of
[Stamina](../terminology/Stamina.md) for [infantry](../terminology/Infantry.md).

The Sensor Shield will also eliminate the sound of your footsteps, making it
impossible for an enemy to hear you.

Sensor Shield will not protect you if you take damage. It will also not protect
you if you are within the [SOI](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md) of a base
with Interlink benefits and you try to use an item
([weapons](:category:Weapons), [REKs](../weapons/Remote_Electronics_Kit.md),
etc.).
