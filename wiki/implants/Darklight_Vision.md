# Darklight Vision

![A cloaker as seen with Darklight](../images/Darklight.jpg){ class="figure" }

![](../images/Darklight.gif) The Darklight implant enables the user to detect cloaked enemies and equipment
([Infiltration Suits](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md),
[Phantasms](../vehicles/Phantasm.md),
[Shadow Turrets](../weapons/Shadow_Turret.md) and
[Wraiths](../vehicles/Wraith.md)) but reduces total sight distance to only a few
meters.

With a one-minute initialization time and a significant stamina discharge, this
implant must be used intermittantly during normal-motion operations, or the user
must remain still to use it continuously.

Darklight takes 3 stamina points to start up. You also cannot use it while in
[Third person](../terminology/Third_person.md) view. Troops with Darklight
activated will have the Darklight icon next to their name.
