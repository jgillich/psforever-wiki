The [Second Wind](Second_Wind.md) Implant provides an emergency reserve of
[Health](../terminology/Health.md) and [Stamina](../terminology/Stamina.md)
which can revive a soldier from near-death, and provide time to find proper
medical attention.

It is always active when installed and
[intialized](../items/Initialization_timer.md). It is automatically triggered
when the user's health drops below a certain critical level, and provides a
one-shot boost of 25 [Health](../terminology/Health.md) and 25
[Stamina](../terminology/Stamina.md), and then must reinitialize again.

Second Wind has the longest
[initialization timer](../items/Initialization_timer.md) of any implant.
