![](../images/Audio_amplifier.gif){ class="figure" } The **Audio Amplifier**
[Implant](Implants.md) amplifies the footsteps of nearby enemy troops, causing
them to appear on your [Proximity Map](../terminology/Proximity_Map.md).
(Normally you need line-of-sight.)

This [Implant](Implants.md) can be countered with the use of
[Sensor Shield](Sensor_Shield.md). Note that this implant works even against
enemies who walk/move while crouched. There is a known bug in which enemy
players who recently exited a vehicle (via bailing or dismounting) are not
always detected with the implant.
