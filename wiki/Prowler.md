**Prowler**

The Prowler is the [Terran Republic](/Terran_Republic "wikilink")'s
[Medium Battle Tank](/Medium_Battle_Tank "wikilink"). It has a tall side
profile and can hold two gunners. Its two gunners can attack different
targets at the same time. Its main gun is a dual-100mm cannon. It fires
fast, can be used at short range and is particularly nasty against
infantry, killing them in one hit. The second gunner can act as spotter
and provide mild defense against dispersed infantry and aircraft using
dual-15mm chainguns.

The Prowler requires a [Technology Plant](/Technology_Plant "wikilink")
lattice link or [Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink") vehicle pad in order
to be purchasable.

Shots to kill (with Dual 100mm Cannons only):
