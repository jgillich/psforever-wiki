The **Repair/Rearm Silo** is a large cylindrical structure attached to two walls
in each continent's [surface bases](../locations/Facilities.md#surface-bases),
and to the [HART buildings](../locations/HART_building.md) in each
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md). They can be used to rearm ground
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) and
[BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md), as long as the base is powered and
in friendly hands. Also, when the facility is linked to a friendly
[Dropship Center](../locations/Dropship_Center.md) or your empire has the
[Oshur](../locations/Oshur.md) [Continental lock](../etc/Continental_lock.md),
they will automatically repair most friendly vehicles and BFRs that approach
them. [Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md) and [Switchblades](Switchblade.md) require the
[Vehicle Module](../etc/Vehicle_Module.md) benefit to repair and recharge at
these terminals.

Also sometimes referred to as a _Ground Repair/Rearm.md Station_ or _Repair
Terminal_.
