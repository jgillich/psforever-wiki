**NTUs** (Nanite Technology Units) are collected from
[warpgates](../locations/Warpgate.md) and active
[geowarps](../locations/Geowarp.md) by
[ANTs](../vehicles/Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md) or
[NTU Siphons](../weapons/NTU_Siphon.md) and stored in facility
[NTU Silos](../locations/NTU_Silo.md) to be converted by
[generators](Generator.md) into power for all base systems.

NTUs are consumed by the base when repairing damaged systems such as the
generator, [Respawn tubes](Respawn_Tube.md), terminals, and
[Phalanx](Phalanx.md) wall turrets. If the NTU level of a base falls to 0%, the
facility becomes [neutral](../terminology/Neutral.md). The level must be raised
above 0% for a successful recapture.

## Game Lore

Nanites make up what we know as Warpgate Energy. It is through these particles
and the way they flow through the gates that everything within Auraxis is
sustained, created, and recreated.

By interpreting these energy flows, Empire scientists are able to make
equipment, vehicles, structures, and even humans appear and dissappear like
magic.

No one really knows what they are, only that we can manipulate them to our own
ends.
