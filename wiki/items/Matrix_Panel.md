Allows a soldier to [bind](../terminology/Matrix.md) to a location as a
[spawn point](../terminology/Spawn_point.md) after death or
[deconstruction](../terminology/Deconstruct.md). Matrix Panels are located on
the side of [respawn tubes](Respawn_Tube.md) and on the front of
[AMSes](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md). They are also located in other
various locations of a base, such as the
[main lobby](../locations/Main_lobby.md), basement areas, and the air vehicle
room at [Dropship Centers](../locations/Dropship_Center.md).

To bind to a panel, approach and press the "G" key when prompted to do so.

To unbind, approach and press the "G" key again when prompted and your bind will
be erased.

Soldiers that have the [Expert Hacking](../certifications/Expert_Hacking.md)
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md) can use the Matrix Panel to
upgrade the [Spawn Room](../locations/Spawn_Room.md)
[Pain Field](../terminology/Pain_Field.md) so that it will do increased damage.
This is done by equipping the [REK](../weapons/Remote_Electronics_Kit.md),
aiming it at the Matrix Panel, and pressing the "Primary Fire" button. A
progress bar will appear similar to the one received when hacking a
[Control Console](../locations/Control_Console.md). The
[Pain Module](../modules/Pain_Module.md) benefit and this process are stackable.
Spawn rooms that have upgraded pain fields from expert hackers show a special
icon on the [Continental Map](../terminology/Continental_Map.md) and will last for 30
minutes after the last boost.
