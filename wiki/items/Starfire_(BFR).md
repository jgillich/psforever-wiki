**Starfire (BFR)**

The [BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) Starfire anti aircraft weaponry
is an adaptation of the similarly named [VS](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md)
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md). It features lock on systems that will
guide in flight projectiles to the currently painted target. Each energy sphere
has an outer plasmoid mass that continues to eat away at the target after the
initial explosive impact. It has no splash damage and does significantly less
damage than the [Starfire](../armor/Starfire.md)
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md). It does a fair ammount of damage to
ground vehicles as well if you can hit them.
