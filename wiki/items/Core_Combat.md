Released on 27 October 2003, **Core Combat** is the first and only expansion for
[PlanetSide](../etc/PlanetSide.md). Adding the Auraxian Core
[Caverns](../locations/Caverns.md)(pre-[Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md)) as a
playable area, Core Combat adds six distinct cavern environments to maximize
tactical potential in the Empire's quests to control
[Auraxis](../locations/Auraxis.md). In addition to the caverns, new vehicles,
weapons and gameplay elements were introduced. When first released, it was
required to purchase the expansion to use the new additions, but it is now
included for free with an account.

## Caverns

The six cavern areas are:

- [Adlivun](../locations/Adlivun.md)
- [Annwn](../locations/Annwn.md)
- [Byblos](../locations/Byblos.md)
- [Drugaskan](../locations/Drugaskan.md)
- [Hunhau](../locations/Hunhau.md)
- [Supai](../locations/Supai.md)

Each cavern is linked to four continental [Geowarps](../locations/Geowarp.md),
adding new [Lattice](../terminology/Lattice.md) links to each
[continent](../locations/Continent.md). However, only two caverns are active at
any given time, making time a critical factor in cavern attacks and usage of the
cavern links.

## Cavern Base Facilities

Down in the caverns, the base facilities are quite different from those that are
on the surface. While they are captured just the same, they do not provide the
same functions that surface bases to. The cavern
[facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) were created to facilitate the creation
and movement of modules to the surface. Four cavern facility types inhabit the
caverns:

- [AT Plant](../locations/AT_Plant.md)
- [Core Complex](../locations/Core_Complex.md) - This is a non-capturable
  facility
- [Module Building](../locations/Module_Building.md)
- [Redoubt Building](../locations/Redoubt_Building.md)

## Modules

Added to spice up gameplay, one of the new features introduced was the
[modules](../etc/Modules.md). When installed inside a surface base facility,
modules grant the facility and the controlling empire certain benefits,
depending on the type of module installed. Currently, six types of modules are
available to be installed:

- [Equipment Module](Equipment_Module.md) (blue)
- [Health Module](Health_Module.md) (yellow)
- [Pain Module](../etc/Pain_Module.md) (beige)
- [Shield Module](Shield_Module.md) (aqua)
- [Speed Module](../etc/Speed_Module.md) (orange)
- [Vehicle Module](../etc/Vehicle_Module.md) (purple)

In order to obtain a module, one must go to the caverns, capture a
[Module Building](../locations/Module_Building.md), obtain a non-powered module,
and take it to the Core Complex to be charged. Once the module is removed from
the [Module Building](../locations/Module_Building.md), the player has fifteen
minutes to charge the module and bring it to the surface. Once on the surface,
the player has an additional fifteen minutes to install the module into a
friendly base. Once the module is placed in a [Module Cradle](Module_Cradle.md),
all bases linked to the module will recieve the benefits. Each
[Empire](../terminology/Empire.md) has a limit to the number of
[Modules](../etc/Modules.md) they have have installed at any given time. If
exceeded, the only way to gain more modules is to steal them from enemy bases
that have them.

## Crystals

Scattered throughout the caverns are multi-colored [crystals](Crystal.md) that
provide different benefits depending on the color. All a unit need do is stand
next to the crystal to activate it. Several crystal structures exist:

- [Damage Crystal](Damage_Crystal.md) (purple)
- [Health Crystal](Health_Crystal.md) (red)
- [Repair Crystal](Repair_Crystal.md) (clear/translucent)
- [Weapon Energy Crystal](Weapon_Energy_Crystal.md) (yellow)
- [Vehicle Energy Crystal](../terminology/Vehicle_Energy_Crystal.md) (green)

## Transportation

There are two methods of transportation unique to the caverns. These are

- [Ziplines](Zipline.md)
- [Teleporters](../terminology/Teleporter.md)

## Weaponry

- [Maelstrom](../weapons/Maelstrom.md)
- [Spiker](../weapons/Spiker.md)
- [Radiator](../weapons/Radiator.md)
- [Ancient Sentry Turret](Ancient_Sentry_Turret.md)

## Vehicles

- [Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md)
- [Router](../vehicles/Router.md)
- [Switchblade](Switchblade.md)
