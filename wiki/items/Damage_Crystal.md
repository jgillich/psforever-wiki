Damage Crystals, are very rare [Crystals](Crystal.md) and can be identified by
its purple color and pointed tips. They're not useful though. When you are in
their proximity, they do damage to your Health, rather similar to the Pain
Fields found in [Spawn Rooms](../locations/Spawn_Room.md).

If you want to find one, there are at least 2 in
[Hunhau](../locations/Hunhau.md). One is located in the North-central area of
grid F-10 by a ramp and can be walked away from. Another one is located in the
top left corner of cell J-14 in a hole by a ramp. Note that unless you are a
[VS](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) [MAX](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) you will
die since there is no way out of the hole. Another one, located in
[Adlivun](../locations/Adlivun.md) cavern, is located at the upper, center of
grid H-15. Just before you get on the UP [zipline](Zipline.md), look down to
your left, into the crevice for it.
