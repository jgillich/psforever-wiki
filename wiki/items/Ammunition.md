# Ammunition

There are two main types of ammunition in [Planetside](../PlanetSide.md):
Hand-held and [Vehicle](../vehicles/index.md).

Hand-held ammunition is stored in your character's
[inventory](../terminology/Inventory.md) and supplied to the appropriate weapon
automatically. Some weapons can use multiple types of ammunition (like
[Armor Piercing](../terminology/Armor_Piercing.md) and standard rounds).

Vehicle ammunition is normally stored in the [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) of
the vehicle and supplied to the appropriate weapon automatically. The
[Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md) and [Switchblade](Switchblade.md) are the
exceptions, using on-board capacitors for ammunition that can only be refiled by
an [Vehicle Energy Crystal](../terminology/Vehicle_Energy_Crystal.md) or
[Vehicle Module](../modules/Vehicle_Module.md) [benefit](../modules/Module_benefit.md).

All ammunition native to your [empire](../terminology/Empire.md) can be obtained
from any [Equipment Terminal](Equipment_Terminal.md). Vehicle ammunition is
availible from the vehicle tab and can be manually loaded into a vehicle's
trunk. [Repair/Rearm Silos](Repair_Rearm_Silo.md) and
[Landing Pads](Landing_Pad.md) distribute vehicle ammunition while you are
inside a vehicle.

Ammunition boxes come in sizes of 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 depending on the weapon.
When obtaining hand-held ammunition, you can find the appropriate ammo box next
to the icon of the weapon you wish to use under the "Weapons" tab. For vehicle
ammunition, the lower pane of the window lists what vehicle(s) the ammunition
can be used in.
