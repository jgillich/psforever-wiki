**Burster**

The **Burster** is the
[Anti-Aircraft MAX](../certifications/Anti-Aircraft_MAX_(Certification).md) of
the [Terran Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md). It boasts two large flak
cannons on both arms that can propel flak for great distances. While it cannot
track aircraft like other [Empire](../terminology/Empire.md)'s
[Anti-Aircraft MAX](../certifications/Anti-Aircraft_MAX_(Certification).md)'s,
enemy aircraft systems cannot detect it until it actually begins doing damage.
The "Anchor" ability locks the [MAX](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) in place
and reduces its field of fire, but essentially doubles it rate of fire and
reduces the size of the cone of fire bloom. (The rate of fire when unanchored is
so low that many pilots will simply ignore it.) The overdrive ability increases
the rate of fire by 50% and still allows the Burster to move, offering a nice
compromise.
