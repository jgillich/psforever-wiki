**Burster**

The **Burster** is the [Anti-Aircraft
MAX](<Anti-Aircraft_MAX_(Certification)>) of the [Terran
Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md). It boasts two large flak cannons
on both arms that can propel flak for great distances. While it cannot
track aircraft like other [Empire](../terminology/Empire.md)'s [Anti-Aircraft
MAX](<Anti-Aircraft_MAX_(Certification)>)'s, enemy aircraft
systems cannot detect it until it actually begins doing damage. The
"Anchor" ability locks the [MAX](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md)
in place and reduces its field of fire, but essentially doubles it rate
of fire and reduces the size of the cone of fire bloom. (The rate of
fire when unanchored is so low that many pilots will simply ignore it.)
The overdrive ability increases the rate of fire by 50% and still allows
the Burster to move, offering a nice compromise.
