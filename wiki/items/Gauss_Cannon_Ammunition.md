**Gauss Cannon Ammunition**

These rounds are used by the [Thunderer](../vehicles/Thunderer.md) and fire in a
straight-line trajectory though move relatively slowly. They do massive damage,
killing any infantry in one shot. It has a very small splash damage area. The
small quantity of rounds per box means that a Thunderer will need to reload
regularly in the field. The boxes can be obtained from any
[Equipment Terminal](Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the vehicle's
[trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or acquired while in the vehicle from a
[Repair/Rearm Silo](Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
