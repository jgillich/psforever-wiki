# Equipment Terminal

![](../images/Equip_Term.jpg "Equip_Term.jpg")

**Equipment terminals** provide troops with
[weapons](../weapons/index.md), ammunition,
[armor](../armor/index.md), support equipment, and vehicle ordnance.
[Ancient-Tech](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) weaponry can also be
acquired if an [Equipment Module](../modules/Equipment_Module.md) is installed or a
[Cavern Lock](../terminology/Cavern_Lock.md) is linked through the
[lattice](../terminology/Lattice.md).

These terminals are crucial to any war effort and can be found in numerous
places. Each [Advanced Mobile Station](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md),
or AMS, supplies two on either side of the vehicle. The
[Respawn Building](../locations/Respawn_Building.md),
[VR Training](../locations/VR_Training.md) Rooms,
[HART building](../locations/HART_building.md), and
[towers](../locations/Towers.md) in each Empire's
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) contain two or more equipment terminals.

All base [facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) provide equipment terminals in
the [Respawn rooms](../locations/Spawn_Room.md) and the
[main lobby](../locations/Main_lobby.md).
[Interlink Facilities](../locations/Interlink.md) and
[Dropship Centers](../locations/Dropship_Center.md) contain extra teriminals on
the top level in the alcove beneath the radar dish.

Every [tower](../locations/Towers.md) also contains equipment terminals in their
Respawn rooms.

To access an Equipment terminal, approach and press the use (default "G") key.
This will open up the acquisition window for the terminal, as well as your
[Inventory](../terminology/Inventory.md) window. You may double-click on an item
or click and drag that item into your inventory.

From the acquisition window you can also save up to 10 unique
[loadouts](../terminology/Loadout.md) of arms and equipment under the
[Favorites](../terminology/Favorites.md) tab. This allows you to quickly arm and supply
yourself for various situations after respawning.

Equipment terminals can be destroyed, and must be repaired to 50% of their
health before they can be used again with a
[Nano Dispenser](../weapons/Nano_Dispenser.md).

The Cavern [Facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) possess
[Ancient-Tech](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) versions called
[Ancient Equipment Terminals](Ancient_Equipment_Terminal.md). They provide the
same equipment as their surface counterparts, including Ancient Tech weaponry.
Ancient Equipment Terminals cannot be destroyed unlike the surface Equipment
Terminals. See [Core Combat](Core_Combat.md).

There is a [known issue](../archive/Known_Issues.md) regarding hacked equipment
terminals not functioning properly.
