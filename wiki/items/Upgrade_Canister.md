Canister\]\]

[Upgrade Canisters](Upgrade_Canister.md) are used in [Nano
Dispensers](../weapons/Nano_Dispenser.md) to upgrade [Wall
Turrets](Phalanx.md) to be able to fire either
Anti-Aircraft or Anti-Armor rounds in addition to the standard
ammunition. One canister is used per upgrade and can be loaded into the
Nano Dispenser by using the "change ammo type" key (default: "X").
