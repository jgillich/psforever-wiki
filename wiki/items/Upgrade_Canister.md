[Upgrade Canisters](Upgrade_Canister.md) are used in
[Nano Dispensers](../weapons/Nano_Dispenser.md) to upgrade
[Wall Turrets](Phalanx.md) to be able to fire either Anti-Aircraft or Anti-Armor
rounds in addition to the standard ammunition. One canister is used per upgrade
and can be loaded into the Nano Dispenser by using the "change ammo type" key
(default: "X").
