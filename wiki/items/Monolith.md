**Monoliths** are golden crystalline structures found all over the many worlds
of [Auraxis](../locations/Auraxis.md).

They serve two purposes:

1.) Locations to find on every world in order to earn the
[Exploration Merit](../merits/Exploration.md)

2.) Items used in the many Events in PlanetSide, including
the [BFR Mayhem](../archive/events/BFR_Mayhem.md) event, the
[Run For the Guns](../archive/events/Run_For_the_Guns.md) event, and the
[Galactic Pathways](../archive/events/Galactic_Pathways.md) event.
