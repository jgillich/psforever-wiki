**Sparrow (BFR)**

The Sparrow Missile Pod is the application of the
[Sparrow](../Sparrow.md) [MAX](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) Anti-Aircraft
weapons platform to the [Peregrine](Peregrine.md). The system
has been adapted for rapid fire release of its clip of missiles, but at
the cost of significantly less damage per missile than the
[Sparrow](../Sparrow.md) [MAX](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md). Unique among the
[BFR Anti-Aircraft](../certifications/BFR_Anti-Aircraft.md) weapons, the Sparrow
has splash damage, making it more useful against light infantry than the
others.
