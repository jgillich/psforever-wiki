**Sparrow (BFR)**

The Sparrow Missile Pod is the application of the [Sparrow](../armor/Sparrow.md)
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) Anti-Aircraft weapons platform to
the [Peregrine](../vehicles/Peregrine.md). The system has been adapted for rapid
fire release of its clip of missiles, but at the cost of significantly less
damage per missile than the [Sparrow](../armor/Sparrow.md)
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md). Unique among the
[BFR Anti-Aircraft](../certifications/BFR_Anti-Aircraft.md) weapons, the Sparrow
has splash damage, making it more useful against light infantry than the others.
