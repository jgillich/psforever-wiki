**Switchblade**

The Switchblade is an [Ancient Technology](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md)
based vehicle which has a fairly heavy amount of armor, but its firepower
depends on whether it is in the deployed or undeployed mode. It travels at a
speed similar to that of an [ATV](../vehicles/ATV.md) with its Scythe energy
weapon firing at a fairly slow rate, with the weapon's movement independent of
the vehicle being limited to only a vertical plane, but when deployed it acts as
a turret with a an extremely rapid rate of fire and the weapon being able to
fire to the same degree on the vertical plane, but also able to fire fully on
the horizontal plane. While terrain and vehicles stop the Scythe weapon
projectile (like every other weapon), infantry do not. This means that the
weapon can hurt infantry standing behind the first infantry target, enabling the
Switchblade to devastate tight clusters of infantry. The Switchblade can also
strafe side to side and travel over water (but cannot deploy on water).

The main drawback is the switchblade goes through ammo quickly. Unlike other
vehicles, you can only get more ammo by going to a
[Repair/Rearm Silo](Repair_Rearm_Silo.md) at a facility with a
[Vehicle Module](../modules/Vehicle_Module.md) benefit, or if you are in the
[caverns](../locations/Caverns.md), at a
[Vehicle Energy Crystal](../terminology/Vehicle_Energy_Crystal.md).
