Each [Capitol](../locations/Capitol.md) has a Force Dome over it that protects
it from all enemy intrusion. The Force Dome can only be taken down by ensuring
that current Capitol owners own less than two of the
[Sub-Capitols](../locations/Sub-Capitol.md). Once that occurs, the Dome goes
down and your attack can begin. (When the Dome goes down, all the Sub-Capitol to
Capitol [lattice](../terminology/Lattice.md) links (on the overhead map) will
begin strobing to alert you to that fact.)

If the Defenders recapture at least two Sub-Capitols than the Dome will come up
immediatly, and any attackers caught inside are instantly destroyed, though any
hack in progress on the capital will still remain in effect. So, attackers will
need to defend the Sub-Capitols as well as attack the Capitol.

An enemy touching the force dome generator (at the top) will be instantly
killed, though the force dome itself acts as a wall. If the empire with the
force dome is stupid enough to place a [Router](../vehicles/Router.md) that goes
to the inside of the dome, enemies can enter and will not be killed. However,
the [generator](Generator.md) cannot be destroyed and any damage to base objects
will not take [NTUs](NTU.md) to repair.
