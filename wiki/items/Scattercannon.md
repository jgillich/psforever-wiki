**Scattercannon**

The [New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md)
[Anti-Infantry MAX](../certifications/Anti-Infantry_MAX_(Certification).md)—the
**Scattercannon**— is comparable to a heavy bore shotgun on steroids. Packing a
whopping 40 shells per magazine, a larger shell and three fire modes, mowing
down infantry has never been easier. The first fire mode is for shorter ranges
with a large spread for close combat. The second fire mode is for mediums
ranges, so it has a slightly tighter spread, require more precision when aiming.
The last fire mode, set for longer ranges has a very tight spread and is
suitable for long range shots, though it takes the most finesse to aim.

Shots to kill (Average Spread in a Close to Medium Distance 5-15 m):
