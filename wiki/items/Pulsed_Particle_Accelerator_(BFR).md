**Pulsed Particle Accelerator**

The Pulsed Particle Accelerator serves the [Aphelion](../vehicles/Aphelion.md)
and [Eclipse](../vehicles/Eclipse.md) as a primarily Anti-Vehicular weapon. It
is an adaptation of the [Magrider](../vehicles/Magrider.md)'s forward facing
light PPA, but it charges particles longer and is attuned to lower frequencies
for better punch through heavily armored targets. The weapon's particles
dissipate after medium distance travel, but makes up for that with consistent
energy damage throughout its range and direct-fire trajectory. While extremely
effective on vehicles and low flying/hovering aircraft, the PPA is not very
effective on light infantry.
