![](../images/PSScreenShot0282.jpg){ class="figure" } The Implant Terminal
inserts cybernetic devices called [Implants](../implants/Implants.md) into
various points, or slots, of a soldier's body.

These devices enhance a soldier's abilities such as speed, senses, stealth,
healing, or data analysis depending on the implant chosen. The terminal is able
to install up to three such devices in a trooper based upon
[Battle Rank](../terminology/Battle_Rank.md).

Implant Terminals are located in the
[HART buildings](../locations/HART_building.md) in each
[Empire](../terminology/Empire.md)'s [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) and
in [Bio Laboratories](../locations/Bio_Laboratory.md) only.

These terminals are destroyable. The only reliable way to destroy one is to put
two boomers near the top of the terminal on the side. Other weapons will have a
very hard time damaging the terminal as the hitbox is so small.

Note: To hack an Implant Terminal using the
[Hacking](<../certifications/Hacking_(Certification).md>)
[Certification](../certifications/Certification.md), stand at the front of the
terminal and point your [REK](../weapons/Remote_Electronics_Kit.md) near the top
of the device to start hacking.

### Interface: Add/Remove Implants
