The **initialization timer** refers to the amount of time each
[Implant](../implants/Implants.md) takes to become available for use from the
time it is "reset." Implants are reset by [spawning](../terminology/Respawn.md)
(after death) or by being hit with a
[Jammer grenade](../weapons/Jammer_Grenade.md) or [EMP](../commands/EMP.md)
blast.

Each Implant has its own timer, which ranges from 1 minute to 3 minutes and 10
seconds, depending on the implant.
