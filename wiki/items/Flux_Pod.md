The **Flux Pod** is the name of the weapon launcher used by the
[Aurora](../vehicles/Aurora.md) armored transport vehicle. It can be fired
semi-automatically or in bursts of 6. Each clip holds 12 pods. The weapon
suffers from severe [cone of fire](../terminology/Cone_of_fire.md) bloom in
semi-automatic fire mode, thus most players use the 6-pod burst fire. While the
burst fire has a large cone of fire itself, it's most effective at ranges where
the [Aurora](../vehicles/Aurora.md) excells: close range. Semi-automatic fire is
best used at medium-long range, but the [cone of fire](../terminology/Cone_of_fire.md)
bloom makes engaging targets at this range almost useless. Flux Pods are purple
and are best against infantry due to their splash damage. Approximately 5 pods
will kill a full-health soldier wearing
[Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) armor.
