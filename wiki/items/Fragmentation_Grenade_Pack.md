_Fragmentation Grenades Packs_ are explosive devices, similar to the
handheld [Fragmentation Grenade](../weapons/Fragmentation_grenade.md),
launched from the [Punisher](../weapons/Punisher.md) or
[Thumper](../weapons/Thumper.md). Unlike rockets, after being launched,
grenades travel in a ballistic arch. When fired from a
[Punisher](../weapons/Punisher.md) or a [Thumper](../weapons/Thumper.md) set
to primary fire mode, the grenade detonates when it comes into contact
with a solid object. When fired from a [Thumper](../weapons/Thumper.md) set
to secondary mode, the grenade detonates after two seconds from the time
of launching. This allows the grenade to be bounced off walls or other
surfaces to hit targets indirectly. Fragmentation Grenades are effective
at damaging infantry as well as armored targets. Furthermore,
Fragmentation Grenades have a generous splash damage meaning a direct
hit is not required to damage a target.

_Fragmentation Grenade Packs_ can also be fired from the [Rocklet
Rifle](../weapons/Rocklet_Rifle.md). When fired in this manner, the
explosive charge travels in a straight line. The charge explodes when it
comes into range of an aircraft or reaches its maximum range. If the
round comes into contact with_any_ object other than an aircraft, the
round will not explode causing very little damage. When used in this
manner, the charges are refered to as **Flaklets**. Flaklets are
effective at damaging aircraft. However, for any other circumstance,
[Rockets](../ammunition/Rocket_Pod.md) should be used instead.

Because Fragmentation Grenades are considered anti-vehicular weapons,
they _cannot_ pass though the energy shields of [BattleFrame
Robotics](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md).
