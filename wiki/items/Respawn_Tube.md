![](../images/PSScreenShot0289.jpg){ class="figure" } A **Respawn
tube**, also known as a Spawn Tube, is where a soldier appears after respawning
from death, after "[deconstructing](../terminology/Deconstruct.md)" at another
tube (see below), or using [Instant Action](../terminology/Instant_Action.md) or
[Recall](../terminology/Recall.md).

**Respawn tubes** are found in base [facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) and
[towers](../locations/Towers.md), as well as the
[Spawn/VR buildings](../locations/Respawn_Building.md) in
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md).
[AMSes](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) do not have **respawn tubes**,
but spawn soldiers randomly within the cloak bubble. Cavern
[facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) (See: [Core Combat](Core_Combat.md)) do
not have **respawn tubes** either, but a respawn "area" in the center of the
respawn room.

**Respawn tubes** can be destroyed, and the destruction of the tubes is one of
the most basic strategies in taking over a
[facility](../locations/Facilities.md).

## Deconstructing

By entering a **respawn tube** a soldier can
"[deconstruct](../terminology/Deconstruct.md)" and respawn at another
[spawn point](../terminology/Spawn_point.md).
