Installing
this [Module](../modules/index.md) provides the
[Module Benefit](../modules/Module_benefit.md) of powering a Force Field across the
Gate, or openings in the [Courtyard](../locations/Courtyard.md) wall.

This Force Field stops ALL weapon fire. Most Vehicles cannot pass through it and
Enemy Infantry speed is slowed to Walk Speed while passing through the Shield.
The [Vindicator](../vehicles/Vindicator.md),
[Juggernaut](../vehicles/Juggernaut.md), and
[Leviathan](../vehicles/Leviathan.md) can pass through the shield with no
penalty.

Friendly Infantry and Vehicles can pass through the Force Field without
receiving Speed Penalties.

This module appears as aqua on the [Continental Map](../terminology/Continental_Map.md).
