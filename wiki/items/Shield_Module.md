[Facility](../locations/Facilities.md) with a Shield Module Benefit\]\]
![](images/Shield_module.jpg "fig:Shield_module.jpg") Installing this
[Module](../etc/Modules.md) provides the [Module
Benefit](../etc/Module_benefit.md) of powering a Force Field across the
Gate, or openings in the [Courtyard](../locations/Courtyard.md) wall.

This Force Field stops ALL weapon fire. Most Vehicles cannot pass
through it and Enemy Infantry speed is slowed to Walk Speed while
passing through the Shield. The [Vindicator](../vehicles/Vindicator.md),
[Juggernaut](../vehicles/Juggernaut.md), and
[Leviathan](../vehicles/Leviathan.md) can pass through the shield with no
penalty.

Friendly Infantry and Vehicles can pass through the Force Field without
receiving Speed Penalties.

This module appears as aqua on the [Continental
Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md).
