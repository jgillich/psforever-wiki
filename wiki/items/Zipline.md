Ziplines are objects located solely within the [caverns](Core_Combat.md) which
allow Infantry (and [MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) Units) to
quickly move between different platforms.

The entry and exit points of a zipline are spheres of energy, and walking into
these will allow you to utilize them.

Ziplines will move you from their entry to exit points (or visa-versa) at a high
speed with or without your weapon holstered (though it is recommended that you
keep your weapon out in case you encounter enemies on the other side of the
zipline). These transportation devices are found throughout each cavern,
allowing access to high buildings as well as rapid movement through the access
tunnels and [Troop Tunnels](../locations/Troop_Tunnel.md).

[Vehicles](../vehicles/index.md) attempting to enter a zipline (or merely
moving to a point where they are touching any part of the zipline) will take
damage. Vehicles parked too close to a zipline node will be given a warning for
deconstruction. Ziplines are different from teleporters in that they are not
instantaneous. While traveling on a zipline, you are able to fire at enemies
without leaving the zipline, note that enemies can also damage you while you are
in travel.

You can "bail" from a zipline by pressing the jump key, allowing strategic
insertions, though unlike bailing from vehicles, you will take damage when you
fall.

Vehicles and Aircraft can knock you off of the zipline if you collide with them
while traveling.

Troops using the ziplines are clearly visible as a brightly colored glowing ball
in transit, colored red for the [Terran Republic](../factions/Terran_Republic.md),
purple for the [Vanu Sovereignty](../factions/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) and yellow for the
[New Conglomerate](../factions/New_Conglomerate.md), and all three can be seen from
some distance away.
