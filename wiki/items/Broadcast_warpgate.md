Considered an upgrade from a normal [warpgate](../locations/Warpgate.md),
broadcast warpgates help Empires shorten the length of travel to the battlefront
by allowing forces to teleport from one warpgate to another along the
[Galactic Lattice](../terminology/Galactic_Lattice.md) and
[Continental Lattice](../terminology/Lattice.md).

These gates are actived by a [locked continent](continent_lock.md) or an
Empire's [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md). Any warpgate physically linked
to this continent becomes broadcast-capable.

If no broadcast link is available, entering the warpgate beam will simply
transport you to the continent that gate is hard-linked to.
