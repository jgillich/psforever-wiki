The **Main terminal** of each [Facility](../locations/Facilities.md) is located
in the [main lobby](../locations/Main_lobby.md).

For Squad/Platoon Leaders the Main terminal can be used to:

- [Recall](../terminology/Recall.md) your [Squad](../terminology/Squad.md) to
  [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) (Must be [Squad
  Leader](../terminology/Squad_Leader.md))
- Recall your [Platoon](../terminology/Platoon.md) to Sanctuary (Must be
  [Platoon Leader](../terminology/Platoon_Leader.md))
- Set Squad's [Home Base](../terminology/Squad_Home_Base.md) (Must be Squad
  Leader)
- Set Platoon's Home Base (Must be Platoon Leader)
- Recall Squad to Home Base (Must be Squad Leader)

Players certed in the [Data Corruption](../certifications/Data_Corruption.md)
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md) can hack into the Main
Terminal of an enemy facility and upload [viruses](../terminology/Virus.md)
that will infect the facility, causing a variety of effects depending on
the virus.

[Expert Hackers](../certifications/Expert_Hacking.md) can access the Main Terminal
at friendly infected facilities to remove a virus, which will return the
facility back to normal.

The Main terminal can be hacked and used by a friendly [Advanced
Hacker](../certifications/Advanced_Hacking.md) when the [base](../locations/Facilities.md) is
hacked by the enemy, provided there is at least one [Spawn
Tube](Respawn_Tube.md) active and the
[Generator](Generator.md) is online.

The Main Terminal can not be destroyed.
