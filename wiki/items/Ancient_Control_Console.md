The Ancient Control Console is the
[Control Console](../locations/Control_Console.md) of a
[Cavern](../locations/Caverns.md) [Facility](../locations/Facilities.md).

They work the same way as the
[Surface Facility Control Consoles](../locations/Control_Console.md) do;
however, the Ancient Control Consoles only have a 10 minute timer on the hack,
as opposed to the 15 minute timer for the Surface Facilities.

These consoles do not spawn [LLUs](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md).
