![ and a
[Vanguard](../vehicles/Vanguard.md) square off](../images/Prowler-Vanguard.jpg){ class="figure" } The collective group term for the Empire Specific tanks
available through the
[Armored Assault II](../certifications/Armored_Assault_II.md) Certification.

Also known as **MBT's**, these vehicles all require a separate driver and
gunner, have around 3500-4500 points of armor and are generally designed to
counter other vehcular threats in an attempt to dominate outdoor battlefield
areas, although specific capabilities vary:

- [Terran Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md)
  [Prowler](../vehicles/Prowler.md): Two Gunners, Independent AI/AA Chaingun,
  High RoF, Steep Shell Arc

<!-- -->

- [Vanu Sovereignty](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md)
  [Magrider](../vehicles/Magrider.md): Driver AI Gun, Amphibious, Strafe, No
  Main Gun Arc

<!-- -->

- [New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md)
  [Vanguard](../vehicles/Vanguard.md): Large Main Gun (150mm), Low Profile,
  Gunner AI/AA Secondary Mode, Low Shell Arc, Largest Armor

All three vehicles can generally shrug off AI weapon fire, and are only really
threatened by concentrated Anti-Vehicular weaponry from multiple units,
minefields, air strikes, or other armor. At full speed, all three cause
signficant damage to any infantry units when driven over (see:
[Transportation Citation](../merits/Transportation_Citation.md))

All Medium Battle Tanks are considered to be 'enclosed' for driver armor
purposes, and so may not be driven while wearing the
[Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md).
