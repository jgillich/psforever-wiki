**Hammer**

The Hammer is a serious anti-infantry weapon, firing a wide spread of shredding
pellets over a short range. The secondary fire mode concentrates the pellets for
medium range work, but at the cost of firing fewer pellets per shot. While the
weapon is lethal to infantry targets, it lacks punch to beat quickly through
heavy armored vehicles.

This is the only [BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) pilot weapon that
has 2 modes, and in the secondary mode, crouching makes the biggest difference
as for the Cone of Fire tightening of all pilot weapons.
