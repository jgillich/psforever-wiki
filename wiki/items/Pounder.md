**Pounder**

The **Pounder** is the [Anti-Vehicle
MAX](<Anti-Vehicle_MAX_(Certification)>) of the [Terran
Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md). It boasts two large mortar
launchers on both its arms that can launch its ammunition over great
ranges. This is an indirect fire weapon, requiring the operator to
compensate for gravity, but making it possible to attack vehicles from
behind a hill. The "Anchor" ability locks the
[MAX](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) in place and reduces its
field of fire, but essentially doubles it rate of fire and reduces the
size of the [cone of fire](../etc/Cone_of_fire.md) bloom. The overdrive
ability can also be used, increasing the rate of fire by 50% while still
enabling the pounder to move.

Shots to kill:
