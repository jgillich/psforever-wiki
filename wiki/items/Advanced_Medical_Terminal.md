The Advanced Medical Terminal fills both Health and Armor as normal
[Medical Terminals](Medical_Terminal.md) do, but does this at a faster rate. The
Advanced Medical Terminals are found only in the
[Medical Bay](../locations/Medical_Bay.md) of
[Bio Laberatories](../locations/Bio_Laboratory.md), just off the main lobby.

To utilize this device, simply walk onto the pad. You will automatically holster
your weapons when the Terminal activates. Drawing weapons or moving off the
Advanced Medical Terminal will cancel it's effect.
