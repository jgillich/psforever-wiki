[Meteors](Meteor.md) are rare phenomena that can occur on any
[continent](../locations/Continent.md). They are large rocks that hit the ground
and do a large amount of damage to anything nearby. Only very heavily armored
vehicles such as [BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) and
[Galaxy Gunships](../vehicles/Galaxy_Gunship.md) can survive a direct hit.

Meteors are only generated when a [SOE](../etc/Sony_Online_Entertainment.md) GM
is online. Meteor showers can be called in a general area and affect a large
area. Single meteors can also be called and directed at players the GM dislikes
at the time. The most common use for meteors is to add atmosphere to a special
[event](../etc/Events.md) or to generally annoy the players in a large battle.
