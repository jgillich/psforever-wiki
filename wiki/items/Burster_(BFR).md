**Burster (BFR)**

The Burster air defense system operates similarly to the
[Burster](../armor/Burster.md) equipped AA
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md), rapidly firing
[Flak](../weapons/Flak.md) shells that explode in proximity to enemy air.
However, it is significantly less deadly than its
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) counterpart. Its fast and
straight-line projectiles means that it is also somewhat effective against
infantry and light armor.
