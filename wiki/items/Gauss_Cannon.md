The Gauss Cannon is the Primary Weapon of the
[New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md)
[Deliverer](../vehicles/Deliverer.md) Variant the
[Thunderer](../vehicles/Thunderer.md).

The Gauss Cannon has a relatively long Refire Rate, very small splash damage,
but deals a lot of damage on a direct hit. One direct hit will kill a soldier
wearing [Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) armor. The Gauss
Cannon fires in a straight line, but the projectile speed is relatively slow.
This gives it a good chance against Ground [Vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md)
and Infantry, but rather low chance of hitting enemy aircraft that are moving.
With two of these weapons firing from a [Thunderer](../vehicles/Thunderer.md) on
the same target, the Thunderer can even challenge
[Medium Battle Tanks](Medium_Battle_Tank.md) and have a good chance of winning.
