![](../images/Drop-pod.jpg){ class="figure" } Drop pods are atmospheric reentry
capsules for individual troop deployment.

Using atmospheric drag and retrorockets, one pod is capable of carrying any
armor class up through [MAX](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md), but not vehicles.

Accessible via the [HART](../terminology/HART.md), a soldier can land a drop pod
on any relatively flat ground outside of an
[SOI](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md) (noting that the SOI covers the
entirety of a [continent locked](../etc/Continental_lock.md) by that empire).
