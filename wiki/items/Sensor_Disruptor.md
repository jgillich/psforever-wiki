**Sensor Disruptor**

The Sensor Disruptor is available to players certed in both
[Advanced Hacking](../certifications/Advanced_Hacking.md) and
[Combat Engineering](../certifications/Combat_Engineering.md). It is deployed by
use of the
[Adaptive Construction Engine](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md) (ACE)
in its Quaternary Mode, and then using the "Change Ammo" function.

Once deployed, the Sensor Disruptor will block all friendly soldiers and
equipment within 30 meters from showing up on any form of enemy radar. It can
not be deployed on buildings or inside an enemy courtyard, but can be placed
within an enemy [SOI](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md).

The Sensor Disruptor is indicated by a big yellow circle on the mini-map as well
as on the continental map. As with all deployables, double clicking on it on the
continental map will give you a pop-up asking if you wish to deconstruct it.
