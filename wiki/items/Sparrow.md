**Sparrow**

The [New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md)'s [Anti-Aircraft
MAX](<Anti-Aircraft_MAX_(Certification)>) **Sparrow**
configuration packs a powerful punch. After a relatively lengthy
lock-on, its anti-air missiles feature a "fire-and-forget" tracking
system, which will follow and attempt to strike the target aircraft for
up to 500m. The automated tracking system makes it hard for pilots to
avoid the missiles, which do reasonable damage. The missiles can also be
dumb-fired and have splash damage upon impact, making the Sparrow quite
useful for defending against infantry as well as aircraft.
