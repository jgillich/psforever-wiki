The Auraxian Core refers to the mysterious mechanics, or spirits, of the
Auraxian System.

It's true form a mystery, it's intent unknown. Embraced by the
[Vanu Sovereignty](../factions/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) as their God, and seen as nothing
more than a wild animal to the [Terran Republic](../factions/Terran_Republic.md) and
[New Conglomerate](../factions/New_Conglomerate.md) that just happens to have control
of their fate.

The core is blamed for [The Bending](../terminology/The_Bending.md), as well as the
appearance of the strange [Monoliths](Monolith.md).

At times, the term **Auraxian Core** is also used as a collective term for the
[caverns](../locations/Caverns.md) when they resided in the center of the planet
Auraxis.
