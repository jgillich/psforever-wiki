The Auraxian Core refers to the mysterious mechanics, or spirits, of the
Auraxian System.

It's true form a mystery, it's intent unknown. Embraced by the [Vanu
Sovereignty](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) as their God, and seen as
nothing more than a wild animal to the [Terran
Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md) and [New
Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md) that just happens to have
control of their fate.

The core is blamed for [The Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md), as well as
the appearance of the strange [Monoliths](Monolith.md).

At times, the term **Auraxian Core** is also used as a collective term
for the [caverns](../locations/Caverns.md) when they resided in the center of
the planet Auraxis.
