Weapon Crystals restore energy to the [Core Combat](Core_Combat.md) Ancient Tech
weapons: [Radiator](../weapons/Radiator.md), [Spiker](../weapons/Spiker.md), and
[Maelstrom](../weapons/Maelstrom.md). To recharge the weapon, simply stand close
to the crystal. The weapon will recharge as long as it is in a
[holster](../etc/Holster.md) (you do not have to have the weapon actually drawn
to recharge...it will recharge even if you are dead!). Before the introduction
of AT weapon clips, this was the only way to restore weapon energy in the
caverns. However, even then their usage was limited.
