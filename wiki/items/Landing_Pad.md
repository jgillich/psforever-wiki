![](../images/PSScreenShot0310.jpg){ class="figure" } The
Repair/Rearm.md Landing Pad, commonly just refered to as a **Landing Pad**, is a
flat platform structure attached to the causewalks of every
[facility](../locations/Facilities.md), and to the roof of
[Air towers](../locations/Air_tower.md). The base versions have the capability
to (when it is linked to a friendly
[Dropship Center](../locations/Dropship_Center.md)) repair any air
[vehicle](category:_Vehicles.md) in the game. Landing Pads can rearm air
vehicles without the Dropship Center benefit.

Landing pads are the only structures that aircraft can land on and not receive a
deconstruction warning message.

Air Towers will both repair and rearm all air vehicles.
