Scattered throughout the [caverns](../locations/Caverns.md) are multi-colored
Crystal Formations that provide different benefits depending on the color. All a
unit need do is stand next to the crystal to activate it. Several crystal
structures exist:

- [Damage Crystal](Damage_Crystal.md) (purple)
- [Health Crystal](Health_Crystal.md) (red)
- [Repair Crystal](Repair_Crystal.md) (clear/translucent)
- [Weapon Energy Crystal](Weapon_Energy_Crystal.md) (yellow)
- [Vehicle Energy Crystal](../terminology/Vehicle_Energy_Crystal.md) (green)
