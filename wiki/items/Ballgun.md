The Ballgun is found on all the [Empire](../terminology/Empire.md)-specific
Sunderer variants: [Leviathan](../vehicles/Leviathan.md),
[Juggernaut](../vehicles/Juggernaut.md), and
[Vindicator](../vehicles/Vindicator.md). They are mounted on the sides of the
vehicle intended to be anti-infantry weapons. The viewing area is small, but if
the user has the [Darklight](../implants/Darklight_Vision.md)
[Implant](../implants/index.md) enabled,
[cloaked](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md) enemies are visible at a longer range
than would be possible with the implant alone.
