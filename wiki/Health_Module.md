Installing this [module](modules.md "wikilink") provides the [module
benefit](module_benefit.md "wikilink") of allowing soldiers that spawn to
do so with 120 health instead of 100. Additionally, friendly soldiers in
the [Sphere of Influence](SOI.md "wikilink") slowly regenerate health over
time, up to the maximum of 120, even if they started with only 100
health points.

This module appears as yellow on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink").
