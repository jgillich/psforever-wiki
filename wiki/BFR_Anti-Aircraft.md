**BFR Anti-Aircraft**

The Anti-Aircraft configuration of [BattleFrame
Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics.md "wikilink") is best suited to combat
enemy aircraft. At a cost of one [Certification
Point](Certification_Point.md "wikilink"), this cert allows the pilot to
utilize three new weapons:

The [VS](VS.md "wikilink") have the [Starfire](</Starfire_(BFR)> "wikilink")
Anti-Aircraft weaponry which is an adaptation of the similarly named
[MAX](Starfire.md "wikilink"). It features lock on systems that will guide
in flight projectiles to the currently painted target. Each energy
sphere has an outer plasmoid mass that continues to eat away at the
target after the initial explosive impact.

The [TR](TR.md "wikilink") have the [Burster](</Burster_(BFR)> "wikilink") air
defense system which operates similarly to the
[Burster](Burster.md "wikilink") equipped AA MAX, rapidly firing flak
shells that explode in proximity to enemy air.

The [NC](NC.md "wikilink") have the [Sparrow](</Sparrow_(BFR)> "wikilink")
Missile Pod, which is the application of the Sparrow Anti-Aircraft
weapons platform to the [Peregrine](Peregrine.md "wikilink"). The system
has been adapted for rapid fire salvo of its magazine of missiles,
resulting in fast kill times on opposing aircraft. The drawback to this
is the relatively frequent reload times as missiles are shuffled into
place in the launch tubes.

It should be also noted that all the BFR Anti-Aircraft weapons, even
when they are paired, are still less effective than their
[MAX](MAX.md "wikilink") Unit counterparts.
