**Shadow Turret**

Shadow Turrets are exactly the same as [Spitfire
Turrets](/Adaptive_Construction_Engine#Spitfire_Turret "wikilink") with
the exception that they are cloaked. Shadow Turrets will only become
visible when firing, and will become cloaked again once they have killed
their target, or the target finds cover.

The maximum number of Shadow Turrets that can be deployed is 5, and they
count toward the total number of Spitfires you can deploy. They also
share the same interference range with the spitfire and [Cerberus
Turrets](/Cerberus_Turret "wikilink"). They can only be deployed in
friendly or [neutral](/neutral "wikilink") [SOIs](/SOI "wikilink").

The Shadow Turret is deployed by the Tertiary Mode of the
[ACE](/ACE "wikilink"), and can be selected with the "Change Ammunition"
function (default is "X").

Shadow Turrets can be detected by use of the
[Darklight](/Darklight "wikilink") [implant](/implant "wikilink"), and
will appear in a similar way as players wearing an [Infiltration
Suit](/Infiltration_Suit "wikilink").
