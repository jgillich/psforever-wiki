**NTUs** (Nanite Technology Units) are collected from
[warpgates](warpgate.md "wikilink") and active
[geowarps](geowarp.md "wikilink") by
[ANTs](Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md "wikilink") or [NTU
Siphons](NTU_Siphon.md "wikilink") and stored in facility [NTU
Silos](NTU_Silo.md "wikilink") to be converted by
[generators](generator.md "wikilink") into power for all base systems.

NTUs are consumed by the base when repairing damaged systems such as the
generator, [Respawn tubes](Respawn_tube.md "wikilink"), terminals, and
[Phalanx](Phalanx.md "wikilink") wall turrets. If the NTU level of a base
falls to 0%, the facility becomes [neutral](neutral.md "wikilink"). The
level must be raised above 0% for a successful recapture.

## Game Lore

Nanites make up what we know as Warpgate Energy. It is through these
particles and the way they flow through the gates that everything within
Auraxis is sustained, created, and recreated.

By interpreting these energy flows, Empire scientists are able to make
equipment, vehicles, structures, and even humans appear and dissappear
like magic.

No one really knows what they are, only that we can manipulate them to
our own ends.
