A **Hotspot** is an area of fighting, and is represented on the
[Continental Map](Continental_Map.md) by an animated yellow
star. The presence of Hotspot stars are one of the main ways a soldier
can gain information on where enemy forces are, and how active and
numerous they are likely to be.

While a single Hotspot flash can be generated by something as small as a
soldier shooting a [Spitfire
Turret](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md) with a
[Decimator](Decimator.md), a wide spread of repeating flashes
can indicate a large-scale mounted offensive.

The Hotspots are the primary method used to determine where a soldier
making an [Instant Action](Instant_Action.md) Request is sent.

Only action involving troops of a soldier's own Empire will be shown as
Hotspots. Fighting involving only members of the other two empires will
not be shown on the map at all. This can often create the impression
that both the other empires are somehow at peace, and 'ganging up' on
the third empire, but this is rarely the case.
