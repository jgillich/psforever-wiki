Greetings Auraxians! Welcome to PlanetSide's 6 Year Anniversary
Celebration! To commemorate this Anniversary we have a few exciting new
additions for everybody!

- All characters created before the six year anniversary update will
  be granted a free respec.
- The [battle rank](Battle_Rank.md "wikilink") maximum has been increased
  from 25 to 40 with a special reward upon reaching 40!
- [Six Year Anniversary](Term_of_Service.md "wikilink")
  [merit](merit.md "wikilink") has been awarded to all Characters that
  are 72 months old!
- [Battle Frame Robotics](BFR.md "wikilink") (BFR)
  [imprint](BFR_Imprint.md "wikilink") will now be given to all
  characters created before June 18, 2009! Everybody with a character
  created before that date will not have to go through the imprint
  process in the [Caverns](Cavern.md "wikilink"). Players will still need
  to purchase the BFR [certification](certification.md "wikilink") from
  one of the [certification
  terminals](Certification_Terminal.md "wikilink") in order to gain
  access to pilot a BFR.

Thank you and weâ€™ll see you on the battlefield!
