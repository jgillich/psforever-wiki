The **Audio Amplifier** [Implant](Implants "wikilink") amplifies the
footsteps of nearby enemy troops, causing them to appear on your
[Proximity Map](Proximity_Map "wikilink"). (Normally you need
line-of-sight.)

This [Implant](Implants "wikilink") can be countered with the use of
[Sensor Shield](Sensor_Shield "wikilink"). Note that this implant works
even against enemies who walk/move while crouched. There is a known bug
in which enemy players who recently exited a vehicle (via bailing or
dismounting) are not always detected with the implant.
