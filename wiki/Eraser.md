**Eraser**

The **Eraser** is a powerful [Medium Assault](/Medium_Assault "wikilink")
pistol. It deals a good bit of damage per hit with a tight [cone of
fire](/cone_of_fire "wikilink"), but small clip size. It also suffers
severe [Damage Degradation](/Damage_Degradation "wikilink") (see graph at
right), making it relatively worthless at targets over 50 meters away.

In the primary firing mode, it fires as a single shot pistol with a
tight cone of fire.

The secondary mode fires all remaining rounds quickly with a very large
cone of fire. You must have at least 75 stamina to fire the secondary
mode. The drawback is that this mode drains all remaining
[stamina](/stamina "wikilink"), leaving you vulnerable to attack. Thus,
you might want to think twice before firing in this mode. There is a
short delay before firing begins with the secondary fire mode (much like
the [Rocklet Rifle](/Rocklet_Rifle "wikilink")), with a distinct sound.
This can sometimes give your target enough warning to move out of the
way.

At close range, the Eraser will kill a soldier wearing
[Rexo](/Rexo "wikilink") armor in 5 shots. The [Spear](/Spear "wikilink")
and [Stinger](/Stinger "wikilink") function identically.
