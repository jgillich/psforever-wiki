Amun is a [Sub-Capitol](Sub.$1.md "wikilink") and [Technology
Plant](Technology_Plant.md "wikilink") on southern
[Solsar](Solsar.md "wikilink"). Nearby are a [Watch
tower](Watch_tower.md "wikilink"), 235m to the south, and [Bio
Laboratory](Bio_Laboratory.md "wikilink") [Horus](Horus.md "wikilink"),
approximately 400m to the west.

The front door faces north, and there is a [pillbox](pillbox.md "wikilink")
outside the southern gate, facing the [Watch
tower](Watch_tower.md "wikilink").

There are hills to the west, east, and south that provide good sniping
points. Any flat terrain near the base is filled with trees and rocks,
practically forcing [vehicles](vehicle.md "wikilink") to stay on the road.
