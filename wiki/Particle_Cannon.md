**Particle Cannon**

The Particle Cannon takes mass-driving to a new level, converting mass
into plasmoid energy and pushing it up to relativistic speeds. This is
the most powerful single-shot anti-vehicular weapon in the game,
featuring a straight-line trajectory, yet relatively large cone of fire.
The weapon leaves behind a minor irradiation field that lingers for a
few seconds, eating away at the armor of anything inside.
