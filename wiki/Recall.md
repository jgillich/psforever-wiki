This option allows a player to [deconstruct](deconstruct.md "wikilink") and
[respawn](respawn.md "wikilink") back in the
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink"). This method is usually used for
regrouping, re-equipping, or to travel to another
[continent](continent.md "wikilink") when access from the previous location
is not possible.

The location of the player affects the [Recall
timer](Recall_timer.md "wikilink").

- Friendly [SOI](SOI.md "wikilink"): 10 seconds
- Neutral SOI or open country: 20 seconds
- Enemy SOI: 30 seconds

A player can initiate a Recall by typing /recall or by selecting that
option in their Esc [Menu](Menu.md "wikilink").
