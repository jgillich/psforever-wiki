This option allows a player to [deconstruct](deconstruct.md) and
[respawn](respawn.md) back in the
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md). This method is usually used for
regrouping, re-equipping, or to travel to another
[continent](continent.md) when access from the previous location
is not possible.

The location of the player affects the [Recall
timer](Recall_timer.md).

- Friendly [SOI](Sphere_of_Influence.md): 10 seconds
- Neutral SOI or open country: 20 seconds
- Enemy SOI: 30 seconds

A player can initiate a Recall by typing /recall or by selecting that
option in their Esc [Menu](Menu.md).
