**Bolt**

Bolt Ammunition is large caliber ammunition for use in the [Bolt
Driver](Bolt_Driver.md) and [Heavy Scout
Rifle](Heavy_Scout_Rifle.md). Bolt ammo is considerably larger
than regular rifle or pistol ammunition, and as such, it causes more
damage to all targets. Furthermore, because of it's increased power over
regular ammunition, weapons firing bolt ammunition have a large increase
in [cone of fire](cone_of_fire.md) after each shot.

Since Bolt Ammunition is for use in small arms, it can pass though the
energy shields of [BattleFrame
Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics.md).
