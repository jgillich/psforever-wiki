### The Doormatic 4000

In main room doors, it is a good strategy to plant
[boomers](boomer.md) in the crook of the door (right where it
closes) because it is impossible to see because the door closes on it,
and when it opens the green circle is under the door, also if you wont
be there for the ensuing destruction, you can plant a mine in the crook
of the door also so whenever someone steps through the door the boomers
will go off and have the potential to take out a whole
[squad](squad.md) (even a few [MAXes](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md)!).
