An Afterburner is a secondary booster system fitted to most aircraft to
provide a short burst of extra speed in emergencies.

The Afterburner runs off a reserve energy cell, shown on the HUD next to
the [Health](/Health "wikilink") and Armor bars. Once activated (Default:
SPACE BAR), the aircraft's speed is increased by around 25%, until the
cell is depleted. The cell will recharge over time when the Afterburner
is not in use.

This speed boost is typically enough to escape most ground-based
threats, although most air-based foes are similarly equipped.

Afterburners are equipped in:

- [Galaxy](/Galaxy "wikilink")
- [Lodestar](/Lodestar "wikilink")
- [Mosquito](/Mosquito "wikilink")
- [Phantasm](/Phantasm "wikilink")
- [Reaver](/Reaver "wikilink")
- [Vulture](/Vulture "wikilink")
- [Wasp](/Wasp "wikilink")

(Note: The [Liberator](/Liberator "wikilink") does NOT have an
Afterburner system. Instead, SPACE will give the pilot a belly-camera
view of the ground below, to aid in setting up bomb runs. To compensate,
the Liberator does have a fairly powerful 25mm Chaingun in the tail.)
