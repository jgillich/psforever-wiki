The **Instant Action** command allows a player to be spawned directly
into combat from anywhere in the game.

The location a soldier is sent to is partly determined by the number and
frequency of [Hotspots](Hotspot.md) on the various
[Planet](Planet.md) maps, along with friendly population already
in place, along with [Empire Lock](Empire_Lock.md) and
[Population lock](Population_lock.md).

To use Instant Action, either type '/ia' or '/instantaction' into the
chat box, or press Esc and select from the menu.

As with [Recall](Recall.md), location affects timer:

- Friendly [SOI](SOI.md): 10 seconds
- Neutral SOI or open country: 20 seconds
- Enemy SOI: 30 seconds

Activating Instant Action will turn off (but not uninitialize)
[implants](implant.md) and deactivate cloak (if any). Moving,
jumping, cloaking or activating implants will all cancel the Instant
Action countdown.

Upon arrival, your [Personal Waypoint](Personal_Waypoint.md)
will be reset to indicate the location of the
[Hotspot](Hotspot.md) that you are meant to respond to.
