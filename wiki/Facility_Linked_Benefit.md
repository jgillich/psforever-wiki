Each type of [base facility](facilities.md) carries with it a
unique benefit for the Empire holding that base. These benefits can be
linked to other facilities via the [Continental
Lattice](lattice.md). A facility can enjoy many benefits from
mulitiple bases through direct and indirect chains of links.

Facility Linked Benefits, or FLB, can be interupted if the base is
[hacked](Capturing_Bases.md) by the enemy, if the
[generator](generator.md) is destroyed, a
[Virus](Virus.md) is uploaded into the [Main
Terminal](Main_Terminal.md), or the base runs out of
[NTU](NTU.md) and goes [neutral](neutral.md). Any
facility linked to this incapacitated base, directly or via a chain of
bases, will lose that base's benefit (except viruses, which affect only
the infected base).

This system is a similar one used for [Cavern
Modules](Modules.md).

Icons on the [Continental Map](Continental_Map.md) represent
each type of benefit associated or linked to that base.

## Available Facility Benefits

- [Amp Station](Amp_Station.md) - (Benefit icon: Shielded
  vehicle) Charges the shield generators of vehicles while they are in
  a friendly [Sphere of Influence (SOI)](SOI.md).

  **Shield Generators:** Each vehicle has a shield generator installed
  in it. When they enter an Amp Station's SOI or the SOI of a facility
  linked to an Amp Station, the shield will begin charging at 5
  armor/second up to its maximum strength, which is 20% of the
  vehicle's base armor. After the shield takes damage, it can recharge
  again if it is within a friendly SOI though any armor damage done to
  the vehicle will remain until it is repaired by an Engineer or at a
  Repair Panel. If a driver takes a shielded vehicle outside of the
  friendly SOI, the shield will remain, though it will not recharge if
  it takes any damage until the driver returned to an Amp Station's
  SOI or any SOI linked to an Amp Station. See [Vehicle
  Armor](Vehicle_Armor.md) for a list of vehicle shield
  strength and the time to fully charge the shield.

- [Bio Laboratory](Bio_Laboratory.md) - (Benefit icon: [Spawn
  tube](Spawn_tube.md)) Reduces respawn times at friendly
  linked facilities.

<!-- -->

- [Dropship Center](Dropship_Center.md) - (Benefit icon:
  Wrench) Enables the Repair ability at Vehicle [Repair and Rearm
  Stations](Repair/Rearm_Silo.md).

  **Rearm and Repair pads and silos** provide a quick and easy way for
  vehicles to repair damage. Each facility is equipped with one or
  more aircraft [landing pads](Landing_Pad.md) and two ground
  panels that will perform this function. When a player is in control
  of a vehicle, they can approach either the pad or panel, depending
  on whether they are controlling an aircraft or a ground vehicle, and
  remain stationary to begin the repair process. Aircraft do not need
  to land on the pad, but they must remain near the pad to be
  repaired. Similarly, ground vehicles will be repaired automatically
  if they remain stationary near the Repair and Rearm Panel. Multiple
  vehicles can use the pads or panels at once. (source: online
  manual)

  Replenishment of vehicle ammunition has since become a free feature
  for all bases, regardless of a link to a Dropship Center. See
  [Repair/Rearm.md Silo](Repair/Rearm_Silo.md).
  Note: [Ancient Tech](Ancient_Tech.md) Vehicles
  ([Flail](Flail.md) and
  [Switchblade](Switchblade.md)) require the [Vehicle
  Module](Vehicle_Module.md) benefit to be repaired and/or
  rearmed, and will not be repaired with the Dropship Center benefit
  alone.

<!-- -->

- [Interlink Facility](Interlink_Facility.md) - (Benefit icon:
  Radar) Enhanced RADAR abilities at all linked facilities.

  Facilities linked to an Interlink Facility will gain certain
  enhancements to their **RADAR systems**. All enemy vehicles will
  appear on RADAR, except for deployed [Advanced Mobile
  Stations](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md),
  [Harassers](Harasser.md), [Mosquitos](Mosquito.md),
  and [Wasps](Wasp.md). All running enemy infantry, including
  cloaked Infiltrators, will appear on the RADAR. Enemy infantry,
  including cloaked Infiltrators, will appear on RADAR if they are
  within a Spitfire Turret or Motion Sensor's detection radius,
  regardless of whether they are moving or not.

- [Technology Plant](Technology_Plant.md) - (Benefit icon:
  Tank) Provides Access to [Advanced Assault
  vehicles](Advanced_Assault_vehicles.md)
