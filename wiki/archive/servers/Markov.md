**Markov** was the PlanetSide server that was located on the western coast of
the United States (San Diego, California). It was merged with the
[Emerald](Emerald.md) server to create the [Gemini](Gemini.md) server on May
20, 2008.

**Markov's** characterbase was a combination of characters from Markov as well
as the shut down [Johari](Johari.md) server.

Characters who came from [Johari](Johari.md) whose names were already in use on
**Markov** had a "-J" appended to the end of their names. These names transfer
to Gemini. If another character already existed on Emerald before the server
merge and had priority over the Markov name, a "-M" was appended to the end of
the Markov's character name. [Outfit](../../terminology/Outfit.md) names followed a
similar rule. See [Gemini](Gemini.md) for more information on character and
outfit naming rules and how to change them if they have a "-M" or "-E" appended.
