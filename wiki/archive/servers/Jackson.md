Jackson was the second European server for [PlanetSide](../../PlanetSide.md), and was
shut down shortly after the release of the game, forcing all European players to
move to the [Werner](Werner.md) server. It was originally used as a promotional
server, used exclusively for an iGames event in 2003. After the event was over,
SOE decided to shut the server down because there weren't enough players in
Europe to warrant opening a second server.
