# Sea Dogs

The Sea Dogs are a band of piratey brothers who specialise in the arts of yarr!
Created by Mungbonesmasher and led by CerealUK at the moment we more than make
our mark on a series of assaults mainly against the NC.

We also have a generator blowing/hack special ops squad that has turned the tide
of many battles.

Next time you see us give us an almighty yarr ;)
