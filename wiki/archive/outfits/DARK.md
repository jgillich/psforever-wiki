**DARK** is an [Outfit](../../terminology/Outfit.md) comprised of mostly older
players who enjoy teamwork and playing in a mature fashion, but still like to
have fun. We have some excellent cloakers and are experienced cave fighters, but
**DARK** has no required focus or certs to join. Prime playing time is 8 pm to
11 pm EST, but with members in multiple timezones, we have people on much of the
time. **DARK** has periodic theme outfit nights as well as scheduled joint
operations with [Celestial Fire](Celestial_Fire.md).

**DARK**'s current Outfit leader is Malign, and our website is at
<http://www.darkhq.com>.
