# Immortal Sovereigns

The **Immortal Sovereigns** was an [Outfit](../../terminology/Outfit.md) originally
created by Aryo on the [Konried](../servers/Konried.md) server at the release of the
[PlanetSide](../../PlanetSide.md) in May of 2003.

It's been a very active outfit since, having seen such memorable leaders as
Skyshot, Johnypilgrim, ISFizz, and currently Spartikus-k.

Overall the outfit has a casual play-style that focuses on organization and
special ops a couple times a week to keep people sharp. We regularly field 1-2
squads in the evenings and small 2-5 man squads during the day.

The **Immortal Sovereigns** host their own [TeamSpeak](../TeamSpeak.md)
server and forums and has grown into a large gaming group with guilds, outfits,
or supergroups on games like EverQuest 2, World of Warcraft, and City of Heroes
just to name a few.

We enjoy working with other outfits and are absolutely at home in armored
columns, [Galaxy](../../vehicles/Galaxy.md) drops on
[Towers](../../locations/Towers.md), to plain old base defense. We like to do it
all!
