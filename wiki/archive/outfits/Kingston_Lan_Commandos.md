## KINGSTON LAN COMMANDOS

The _Kingston Lan Commandos_ is always looking for players to join our
[outfit](../../terminology/Outfit.md). We are dedicated players who are skilled and
have varying specialities. The only requirements that we have is that you can
shoot the enemy. Most of us use [Teamspeak](../TeamSpeak.md), but if you
dont use it no problem. Well if you are looking for an outfit that is easy going
and kills shit, look no farther.

HERE IS THE OUTFIT WEBSITE: [1](http://www.kingstonlancommandos.org)

Just post on the general board that you are looking to join. Or in the game send
tell to duffman626, pytheas-k, plattner, welmek or LMC.
