Section 8 Blue was originally formed as
[Terran Republic](../../factions/Terran_Republic.md) Outfit Section 8 on the
[Markov](../servers/Markov.md) Server by ColonelOneil and DocGoodwrench on Dec
22, 2003. On Jun 10, 2004, we defected to the
[New Conglomerate](../../factions/New_Conglomerate.md). Section 8 is currently run by
DocBadwrench. We are located on the web at
[Section8Server.com](http://www.section8server.com).
