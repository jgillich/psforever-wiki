The 58th Marine Corp has been operational since the 6th of July 2003.

We are a multi-game clan, however our roots are firmly set in PlanetSide where
we are a major force on the Werner server, fighting for the New Conglomerate.
Within the past few months we have started to move into new games taking our
expertise from Planetside into Battlefield 2, City of Heroes and World of
Warcraft (where we have a 100-strong guild running - The Twisted Wildcards).

We have 2 massive Teamspeak servers, one for Planetside, and one for Battlefield
2, City of Heroes and World Of Warcraft. You will see the Planetside server
regularly hits 90 users however this is not a problem as both have unlimited
capacity and run from high-spec dedicated servers. Please note that both servers
are available exclusivley to Marines and allies of the Marine Corp.

We offer one of the most advanced websites ever to grace a clan, running off
only the best Content Managers and Message Board software. Our site is regularly
updated with news, patches, and other important information. We have a large
forum catering for all games with extra sections for tech-support, off topic
chat, and much more!
