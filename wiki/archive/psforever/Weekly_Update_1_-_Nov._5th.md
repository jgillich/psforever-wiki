Just a short update to let everyone know that I'm alive. Been overly busy with
that thing people call "real life", so I haven't had much cycles for the
project. Don't worry though, things should lighten up towards the end of the
year. I'll try to keep you guys updated on a weekly basis at a minimum. That way
the project stays fresh and keeps moving forward.

**Wiki**

The wiki is setup and running. It's not pretty yet, nor well organized, but that
will come. Thanks a lot to p0intman for grabbing as much from Planetside
Syndicate's wiki as he could before it fell over.

**PlanetSide Capture files**

I'm sure people who have been capturing have a store of capture files they would
like to submit by now. I need to make a capture submission for you all and I
also want to be ready to actually process all of the packets. I'm not ready yet,
so I that's why I haven't asked for the files. I'll let you know when I am.

**Actually making PSForever**

I've been spending a lot of time reading papers and looking at other projects
for a good architecture and road map for server development. Most private
servers I know about are excellent projects and learning from them is great.

In actual game terms, I did some heavy reverse engineering of the initial login
packets and I have a good understanding of what is required to get a login
server running. Now I could just rush and implement a login server, but with
major questions of programming language choice and architecture floating around
in my head, I'd rather not wade in just yet. Having a good programming plan will
make things easier down the road for me and possibly any other contributors.
