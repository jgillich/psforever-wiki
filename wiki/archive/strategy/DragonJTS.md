## What is a tower

A tower is a small, several story structure, usually just outside a facility.
They all have a CC, 2 doors each on their roof and ground floor with
[IFF](../../terminology/IFF.md) locks, and a spawn room with tubes, lockers, and
equipment terminals. There are three types.
[Air towers](../../locations/Air_tower.md) feature two landing pads that
Repair/refit aircraft, and two wall turrets.
[Gun towers](../../locations/Gun_tower.md) feature two wall turrets.
[Watch towers](../../locations/Watch_tower.md) have no guns, but are five stories
and feature a middle “balcony”.

## Why is it important

Any veteran will tell you that holding a facilties tower is a key point to
taking the facility. They provide a spawn location near an enemy facility, much
like an [AMS](../../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md). A tower, though in a
fixed location at the edge of a facilites
[SOI](../../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md), has several advantages over an AMS.
First off, it has it's own SOI, meaning enemy's can't drop certain
[CE](../../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md) devices just outside the door.
Also, since it's a structure, it can't be destroyed, and protects infantry from
[OSs](../../terminology/Orbital_Strike.md) and vehicles. One of it's biggest
advantages, however, is that it allows access to
[MAX](../../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) suits, a feature that the AMS is
lacking.

## Defending

First and foremost, CE is key. Place
[boomers](../../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#remote-detonated-charge-boomer)
on the inside door, one each, and an alarm near the
[CC](../../locations/Control_Console.md). Heavily mine the outside.
[Spits](../../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#spitfire-turret) and alarms
aren’t too useful outside, as vehicles will probably show up early, and then
easily destroy them, without taking much damage. Mines, however, will wreak
havoc on them. A very deadly combo is a combination of
[Disruptor Mines](../../weapons/Disruptor_Mine.md)
a../certifications/Anti-Vehicular.mdcular.md). The mines make it so vehicles
can't fire their weapons, leaving them open to a salvo of AV rockets. MAXs
should set up just inside the door, on the stairs towards the CC. If the people
using them have [DL](../../implants/Darklight.md), they should activate it. Once
the enemy is inside, push hard from the spawn room, and head either to the CC,
or keep pushing the enemy outside. If you can bring in vehicles from an outside
source, do so, or else enemy vehicles will seal you in. Once they reach the
spawn room, try your best to kill them, calling for some CC defence to help
(keeping in mind it's probably also under siege). Repair the spawn tubes and
terminals as necessary. Also keep an eye out for airdrops on the roof.
[SA](../../certifications/Special_Assault.md) will be really useful in shoving back
anyone who comes through the main floor. Just sit on the lower and upper
landings, aim at the ground floor, and fire (after making sure it’s clear of
friendlies). Standard weaponry is all that’s needed for taking out air droppers.
However, despite this, once the tower has troops inside, it’s near impossible to
beat them back without outside support. in a heavily forested area, a
[TRAP](../../weapons/Tactical_Resonance_Area_Protection.md) may be able to
bottleneck people, but in an open space the high influence radius makes it
little more then a target. [Cerberus turrets](../../weapons/Cerberus_Turret.md)
placed on the roof/ground may help prevent mossies campers, but will do little
to stop droppers and ground forces. Also keep an eye out for phantasm, who can
easily drop half a squad onto your roof with no warning. Shadow turrets,
however, can make a heavily defended roof appear an easy target, perfect for
ambushes on droppers.

## Attacking

Attacking is quite a bit easier. First, bring in vehicles to take out spits and
enemy troops, as well as other vehicles. Once you have the outside secured, then
set up a vehicle perimeter, and start firing inside once the doors open (until
your own side starts going through, of course). If you have the means, drop on
top, and attack the CC, forcing the defenders to guard from two angles. Once
inside the main floor, try to set up some people to keep the enemy trapped in
the basement (MAX’s and SA is really useful), but send the main force to the CC.
If you can get down to the basement, take out the tubes. Try not to have
everyone run downstairs, lest the respawned troops escape back to the CC. As you
kill people guarding the CC, you can hopefully keep them trapped downstairs,
unable to do anything until the tower is yours, leaving them nowhere to spawn,
and trapped in a [pain field](../../terminology/Pain_Field.md). Like mentioned in
the defense section, once you hold the outside, it’s going to be hard for them
to take it back, though you should keep an eye open for outside attacks, which
are your biggest threat. If your on the outer part of an facilities SOI, or
attacking a lone tower, a [OMFT](../../weapons/One-Manned_Field_Turret.md) can help
in keeping people contained, especially in a lone tower, where both doors can be
covered. An [Aegis Shield Generator](../../weapons/Aegis_Shield_Generator.md) can
also provide a good hiding place for unmanned vehicles, so they don't fire on
them if they start to push out, and soldiers can easily get in them and push
them back in. Someone with
[Assault Engineering](../../certifications/Assault_Engineering.md) can also place
spitfires just outside the doors, making for a nasty surprise when defenders try
to push out.
