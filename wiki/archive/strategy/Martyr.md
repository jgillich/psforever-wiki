**martyr's Stragies and Tactics**

note: I lead the now-disbanded Strategic Air Command of my outfit, Sons of Vanu.

**SOPs**

---

_Mission_

To support and supplement Sons of Vanu operations via airborne infantry & armor
delivery, aggressive air superiority, and supressive air-to-ground capabilities.

_Aircraft Aquisition_

During offensive operations, SAC pilots bind to the nearest cont-locked friendly
facility capable of generating approprate aircraft.

All aircraft have 5 minute spawn counters.

_Vehicle Storage Spaces_

All vehicles (space permitting) can carry non-vehicle ammunition and other
items/weapons placed in their trunks. If a favorite is created with these items
still in the trunk, they will be loaded with the favorite.

_SAC reccomends:_

- Favorites created for every AC cert held
- REK
- Repairgun, if not already in pilot's armor inventory \*
- Sufficient nanite canisters to repair your aircraft at least once from a
  "control lost" state\*

<!-- -->

- Regardless of pilot's engineering certification

_TeamSpeak_

All pilots should be in voice contact during SAC operations.

During multi-squad, practice, or testing operations, SAC pilots use _Strategic
Air Command_ channel on the SoV TS server.

End each transmission with an identifier.\[quote="Example"\]Three commie

_Strategery_

There will be no Strategery. Thank you.

**POH**

_'Setup_

Fly with mouse & keyboard. There is little/no joystick support.

Check your keybinds, confirm locations of:

- Vertical Thrusters: Up, Down (default "e" , "c")
- Afterburner (default spacebar)
- 10% power increments (default numbers)
- 1% power increment keys (default "," , "." )

_Aircraft Loadouts_

When AC is generated, fly to nearest refit facility and load appropriate
favorite as defined in SOPs.

If avaliable, charge shields completely.

_Aircraft Repair & Rearm_

Rearm/Refit facilities include any facility linked to a dropship center and any
air tower.

To initiate reload: hover within 10m of aircraft pad. A prompt will instruct
"Press G to reload from this terminal."

Your aircraft will also be repaired whenever you're within reloading radius
regardless of relative position. Consider hovering underneath or parallel to the
Refit pad if it is crowded or the air is hot.

_Parking_

Don't park like an ass

Try to park with SAC

Four attack craft per pad

Always lock your canopy
