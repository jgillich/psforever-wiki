[Back Door](../../locations/Back_Door.md)](../../images/ANT_Trap_Above.jpg){ class="figure" } What is it? Well after watching all my
[CE](../../certifications/Combat_Engineering.md) get [EMP](../../terminology/EMP.md)'ed
over and over again. I though, what if an ant was blocking the door and they
emp'ed all my mines and it blew the
[ANT](../../vehicles/Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md) and killed them all? So I tested
it out and guess what? It works!

Every squad has at least one [CR3](../../terminology/Command_Rank.md) or greater,
so most infantry assault squads will EMP an area before moving on the backdoor.
So why do you still put up CE? It slows them down enough for your squad to react
to the drop.

Lets go over the game plan, it's very simple.

### Outside

1. CE's, mine the area outside of the backdoor, place one mine in front of the
   door. Use all your spits to create a kill zone.

<!-- -->

1. Get an ANT. Park it at the backdoor, test it by trying to squeeze by. If you
   can't then its setup properly.

<!-- -->

1. [Boomers](../../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#remote-detonated-charge-boomer)!
   Deploy all twenty boomers around the ANT and mine field. Store the sticks in
   your locker or place them in a stairwell.

### Inside

1. CE's, place a
   [Motion Sensor](../../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#motion-sensor-alarm)
   right on the backdoor in the middle. So you open the door, look up and place
   the motion sensor. You can not pass the sensor without crouching under it as
   an Agile (NOTE - Reinforced and MAXES cannot pass). **UPDATE** _- Place a
   spitfire right below the motion sensor, it will take some practice, but the
   door should hide the spit._

<!-- -->

1. Go to the [gen room](../../items/Generator.md) area, we all know the fastest way
   to the gen room right? Well after you breach the backdoor and enter the main
   area, take the right and place a motion sensor on the door leading to the
   basement. Place another motion sensor on the main gen room door, center it
   and try to get by. If you can get by any sensors, destroy them and try again.

### So lets recap

CE the hell out of the backdoor area, place your sensors correctly, park your
ANT, grab your lasher or thumper and have fun!

## UPDATE: The ArmorDeth AMS Trap

What if you changed the ANT to a deployed cloaked
[AMS](../../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md)? Let me tell you what happens when
you do that. Fun! When an enemy drops they will not see the CE due to the
cloaked bubble. Once they land and fire off an EMP, boom baby! The mines and
boomers will go off and destroy the AMS and we all know how much damage an AMS
can do.

Fun Stuff!
