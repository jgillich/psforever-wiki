## Character Creation

Welcome to PlanetSide, the best massive-multiplayer first-person shooter
(MMOFPS) out there. Let's get started!

**NOTE:** Offline training _does not_ work at present. Just completely ignore
offline training. Everything you could learn from offline training, you will
learn in game.

Start out by logging in and choosing your nearest server and your preferred
[Empire](../../terminology/Empire.md), throw in a name, pick a face and voice, and
head into sanctuary.

## VR training

When you spawn in your [Sanctuary](../../locations/Sanctuary.md), walk out the door
and take a sharp left or right, and walk around the corner of that same
building. You'll see a set of three doors up some stairs; head into any of them.

Choose 1 or 2 (do both). Every new item you <i>equip</i> gives you a number of
[Experience Points](../../terminology/Experience_Points.md)- anywhere between 50
and 200. So equip every [weapon](../../weapons/index.md) and support item
you can, fire them if you want to. Putting on
[Rexo](../../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) armor makes this process faster.

- Don't forget, each [MAX Armor](../../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) has
  its own weapon systems, and they award you
  [Experience Points](../../terminology/Experience_Points.md) also.

To leave VR, hop into one of those prism-looking beams.

Same goes for vehicles; you'll spawn next to the ground vehicle pad. Drive
everything. If it has a gunner spot, park and hop in the gunner slot too.

When you're done, visit the [BFR](../../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) shack
(just a touch northeast of the vehicle pad) and use both battle frames. if you
want to switch out weapons, walk it over to the rearm silo behind the ground
vehicle pad you were just using, it's on the hill to the east of the
vehicle-pad.

Then head to the airpad, it's a good distance, heading west by southwest. It's
up on a hill, use your map to pinpoint it. There, do the same thing. fly
everything, use all the gunner seats.

By the time you finish this, you'll have gone from
[BR1 to BR4](../../terminology/Battle_Rank.md), and you'll be up to seven
[Certification points](../../certifications/Certification_points.md).

## Load up and ship out

From your spawn point, head towards the massive, blocky, looming building, known
as the [HART Building](../../terminology/HART.md). Inside, find a
[Certification Terminal](../../items/Certification_Terminal.md) and get some
[Certifications](../../certifications/Certifications.md). Don't worry, they're not
permanent (as a new character, you can switch them as often as you want during
your first week).

Then find an [Equipment terminal](../../items/Equipment_Terminal.md), just like in
the VR shooting range. Get [agile](../../armor/Agile_Exo-Suit.md) armor (at least),
and load up on gear. When you have a suitable loadout, switch to the favorites
tab and save the configuration. Next time, you can run up to the terminal, hit G
then the number key, and you're good to go.

If you know where you want to go, get on the [HART](../../terminology/HART.md) when
it comes in (every 5 minutes). You'll hear it. If you don't, hit escape and use
"instant action." That will [spawn](../../terminology/Respawn.md) you at a facility
near a hotspot, putting your personal (white) waypoint on where it thinks the
fight is. This isn't 100% accurate, because humans are unpredictable, but it
usually will get you some action.

## In the field

Your [Map](../../terminology/Continental_Map.md) will always save you. M key by default, it shows
hot spots - where there's gunfire. Also, you can right-click anywhere on it to
set a personal [waypoint](../../terminology/Waypoint.md), making navigation easier.

Communication is the second thing you'll run into. There are a number of text
commands you can use to talk on different channels. The backspace key replies to
/tell, and /s is for squad chat. There's a full list
[here](../../chat/In-Game_Commands.md).

## Other Tips

- Q is autorun or 100% thrust (except in a BFR, where it's \`).
- The U key pulls up your character info.
- Alt+N toggles on outfit names.
- \[ and \] zoom in and out on your minimap.
- Use AI ammo (white) on infantry, use AP (gold) on maxes and vehicles. this
  doesn't change, regardless of how much armor they have.
- You can tell rank by armor color. Brighter (more gold/red/green) is higher.
