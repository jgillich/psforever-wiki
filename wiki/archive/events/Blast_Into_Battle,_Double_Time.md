The following features/settings changes are added for the Event.

- Base captures experience has been doubled
- [Squad](../../terminology/Squad.md) member experience has doubled based on close
  and long range proximities to your other squad members
- We doubled the amount of time that you can get
  [Support Experience](../../terminology/Support_Experience_Points.md) from other
  soldiers or [vehicles](../../vehicles/index.md) in these areas:
  - Soldiers spawning and re-equipping at your
    [AMS](../../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md)
  - Healing and reviving soldiers
  - Repairing another soldiers armor
  - Repairing a damaged [vehicle](../../vehicles/index.md)
  - Vehicles rearming or repairing at your [Lodestar](../../vehicles/Lodestar.md)
  - Soldiers using your hacked Medical, Equipment, Vehicle or BFR terminal
  - Soldiers bailing from your [Galaxy](../../vehicles/Galaxy.md)
  - Soldiers using your [Router](../../vehicles/Router.md) and Telepad
- [Implant](../../implants/index.md)
  [certifications](../../certifications/Certification.md) have been reduced from
  [Battle Ranks](../../terminology/Battle_Rank.md) 6, 12 and 18 allowing you to now
  play with two Implants at Battle Ranks 6 and another at Battle Rank 7
- Increased the [HART](../../terminology/HART.md) docking time making it easier for
  those who continually miss the flight
- Reduced the HART rotation allowing you to get to battles much easier.

**Implant changes were later reset due to issues with lost
[Certifications](../../certifications/Certification.md).**
