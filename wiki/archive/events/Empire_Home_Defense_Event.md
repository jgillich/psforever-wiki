On Friday, July 29, 2005, we will be running the Empire Home Defense Event!

In this event, one [Empire](../../terminology/Empire.md) (chosen manually,
generally the empire with the highest population at the time) will defend both
of their home continents simultaneously in two two-way battles against the other
two empires.

Below are the times the events will be run on the servers:

**[Werner](../servers/Werner.md) 11:00 am Pacific Time (7:00 pm UK, -7.00 UTC)**

**[Emerald](../servers/Emerald.md) 4:00 pm Pacfic Time (7:00 pm East Coast, -7.00 UTC)**

**[Markov](../servers/Markov.md) 7:00 pm Pacific Time (-7.00 UTC)**

Preparations for the event should be made ahead of time. There will be a 30
minute warning message before these listed times. This message will announce
which empire will be the one defending, and which continents the attacking
empires should be on. The battles will begin at the times listed above so make
sure you prepare beforehand.

The attacker wins by capturing the zone capitol within 3 hours.

The defender wins by holding their capitol for this long.

**Rewards:**

- The winning empire will gain access to the losing empire's vehicles for 48
  hours after the attack resolution.

<!-- -->

- Individuals will be secretly chosen for a special event merit. A list of the
  individual winners will be posted on Monday. However, the merits themselves
  will not be made available until the next update.
