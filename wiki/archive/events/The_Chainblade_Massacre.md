the general gameplay is the same for all years.

### [Extinction](../../locations/Oshur.md#Extinction)

This isle is a barren wasteland in the middle of the salty sea. However, this
Halloween, it's not going to be great tank country this season.

On Halloween and the days surrounding, they'll be no trick or treating in
[PlanetSide](../../PlanetSide.md). The blood of the enemy will spill on the dunes that
stretch across the island of Extinction, but it will not spill from ammunition
of firearms nor from the explosion of rockets. No! The blood in this battle will
spill only from combat knives. It will be bloody. It will be dangerous. It will
be the [Chainblade](../../weapons/Chainblade.md) Massacre.

Upon entering the massacre lands, soldiers will be subject to the following:

- [Infiltration Suits](../../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md) and
  [standard armor](../../armor/Standard_Exo-Suit.md). Soldiers will zone in with
  standard armor but upon death, they will be given infiltration suits. It is a
  good idea to grab an infiltration suit upon entering the zone. If you choose
  not to, you will soon realize why.
- Empire specific knives will be your only protection against that which lurks
  in the shadows
- The only vehicles available are [Wraiths](../../vehicles/Wraith.md),
  [AMS](../../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md),
  and [ANTs](../../vehicles/Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md).
- [Empire](../../terminology/Empire.md) specific Jack-o-lanterns will replace the
  backpack corpses.
- Before joining the massacre, we advise careful planning of your
  [implants](../../implants/index.md). With so many spooky ghosts and ghouls
  around, you'll probably want to have [Darklight](../../implants/Darklight_Vision.md)
  handy.
- Each empire will have a predetermined base. Hacking of the bases will be
  permitted and you will receive experience. However, if the death toll has
  risen to a certain level within the
  [SOI](../../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md), the base will be recaptured to the
  previous empire for corpse retrieval.
- Assassination attempts and moreâ€¦

Come join the battle and the ghoulish fun.

### Assassinations

Off in the distance, you hear a voice yelling, "Stop him! He's one of them!"

Within the [Terran Republic](../../factions/Terran_Republic.md) a secret assassination
organization formed up after a difference of opinions about empire assault
tactics and other confidential matters. This organization vowed to take down
high officials not only in the Terran Republic but within the other empires as
well. Did they consider themselves the true fourth empire? No. They considered
themselves the new rulers of the Auraxian System overall and plotted to destroy
all three empires.

High officials in the Terran Republic discovered information about this
organization after a failed assassination attempt. The assassin was quickly
slain after vital information had been beaten out of him. The other members of
the organization got word that their secret had been discovered so they
immediately went into hiding. Some remained hidden within the Terran Republic,
while others scattered into the [New Conglomerate](../../factions/New_Conglomerate.md) and the
[Vanu Sovereignty](../../factions/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) empires. They continue to remain in
contact with each other. In order to remain out of sight, they changed their
tactics and decided to cloak their way to victory quietly.

Each empire has offered a [merit](../../merits/index.md) reward to
anyone who "infiltrates" the organization and assassinates the assassinators.
However, assassinating someone hidden within your own empire will not be
rewarded and will result only in grief. The organization member names have not
been discovered but soldiers killing a member will secretly find themselves
rewarded with the merit.
