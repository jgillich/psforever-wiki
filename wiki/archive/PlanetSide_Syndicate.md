##### PlanetSide Syndicate

**"We're here to help you learn all about Planetside. We think it's an amazing
creation unlike any other game out there.** **Of course, the rich variety in the
game means there's a lot to learn on the way to becoming a loyal and effective
soldier of your empire."**

The Syndicate network, site, and wiki are a conception of a team of
Administrators.

Upon the announcement of the (temporary, although unknown at that time) closure
of PlanetSide Universe (PSU), the administrators began designing and building a
site to preserve the wealth of data housed at PSU as well as establish a site
with a new and broader set of services.

The intent of the Planetside Syndicate is to provide a comprehensive basic
information portal for current and potential Planetside players, and in so
doing, augment the currently avaliable sites and resources.

Founding Administrators: Rahl, Elana, Shamoox, rev, Hayoo, martyr

Original Participating Organizations:

`PlanetSide Idealab` `PlanetSideStats.net` `PlanetSide Comics`
`Syndicate Radio Network`

The only website still operational, though no longer updated, is the PlanetSide
Idealab.

Launch Date: January 31, 2005

##### Current State

PlanetSide Syndicate was last edited on February 19th,2011, and for
all-intensive purposes is now a dead site. PlanetSide Forever has mirrored the
site for archival purposes, as well as to build and improve on it. It is our
hope that we can restore the content of PS Syndicate and shape it into a
comprehensive and user-friendly wiki page for all [PlanetSide](../PlanetSide.md)
players to use.
