Terran Republican Guard has existed as one of the top TR Markov outfits for as
long as the Auraxian war has prevailed. Working as a highly efficient platoon,
the TRG is a medium sized outfit which specializes in elite special operations.
Whether it may be dropping Vanu generators, surprising our enemies from a sudden
attack in the rear, or stealing mods from hostile bases, you can count on the
TRG get it done rapidly and with great precision.

Known for it's desire to contest even the greatest of competitors, outfits such
as the Terran Republican Guard and the '666th Devil Dogs' go head to head on a
uniform basis.

We are alive and active and recruiting this very day, a positive attitude and a
will to work together with your teamates is all that is required. New recruits
are welcome and experienced players are encouraged, we offer training and a
challenge you can find nowhere else.

Every so often TRG holds a raid night, which is a theme night that encourages
different styles of play from the norm. Do not be suprised to see 30+ TRG maxes
rush past the feeble defenses of our Vanu Sovereignty and New Conglomerate
enemies, or 15 full liberaters flying overhead with the TRG logo displayed
proudly and prominently on the underbellies of these magnificent craft.

Support is provided to all players. There is always a ride and a medic by your
side.

One of the keys to TRG success is the use of teamspeak, which is very strongly
encouraged.
