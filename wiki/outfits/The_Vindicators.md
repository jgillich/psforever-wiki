We are an outfit that concentrates on team play and coordination.

We are one of the larger, more successful Outfits in the game due to the
dedication and skill of our members, who have kept the Outfit going since Beta.

We are expanding at the moment, gaining new members all of the time, if you want
to be part of this growing, exciting outfit, talk to us at
<http://www.thevindicators.com> we also have a teamspeak server at
xerxes.nullify.net.

You can typically find us running armour columns, galaxy drops and supporting
the empire with advanced medics, engineers and AMS drivers.

All roles are welcome, all skill levels welcome, as long as you're willing to
use Teamspeak, work with the outfit and make friends, you're more than welcome
to join.
