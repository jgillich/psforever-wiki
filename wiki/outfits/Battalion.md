## Bios

Battalion is an epic [New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md)
[outfit](../terminology/Outfit.md), on the [Emerald](../etc/Emerald.md)
server, which boasts countless victories through systematic raids on
bases of enemy empires. Battalion was founded by
[Pedromdrp](user:Pedromdrp.md) in 2003.

Over time, members of Battalion have migrated to fulfil other ambitions,
mostly involving the Real World.

However, we wish to bring Battalion to power once more, with as many
members as possible to counter the enemy empires which wish to oppress
and radicalise!

Ultimately, every human has a role to play. Battalion members appreciate
any help, whether you're at the front lines with your Jackhammer,
manning a turret, or providing medical aid and repairs, you're still a
valued member!

## Agenda

We believe in strength in numbers, and we need YOU in order to help
become a powerful whole. Don't pass up this opportunity to join
potentially the most tactical outfit of the New Conglomerate!

Work your way up the ranks to increase your recognition:

\- Commanding General

\- Second-in-Command

\- Captain

\- Lieutenant

\- Cadet

\- Sergeant

\- Corporal

\- Private

Cadet is the most respected non-officer rank. Promotions are dynamic and
members are frequently assessed by the officers.

Join today! See a Battalion officer or visit the website at

We look forward to your participation!

Players should request a tryout from one of our active members.
