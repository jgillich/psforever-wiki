Version 3.9.5 Brief Update (October 6 2005)

[Rabbit](Rabbit.md "wikilink") Changes:

- Cut the Rabbit carrier [health](health.md "wikilink"), armor, and
  [stamina](stamina.md "wikilink") regeneration rates in half.
- Fixed script error that would cause "[zone](zone.md "wikilink")
  unlocked" messages to be broadcast once per second whenever there
  was more than one locked zone at a time.
- Made the Rabbit streak limit be per [empire](empire.md "wikilink")
  instead of per player. Any time one empire scores 100 straight
  points with one ball it will reset, regardless of how many different
  players carry it during that period.
