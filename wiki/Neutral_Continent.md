A **Neutral Continent** (or Neutral Planet in the
[Post-Bending](The_Bending.md "wikilink") era) is simply a
[planet](planet.md "wikilink") which does not possesses a direct link to an
[Empire](Empire.md "wikilink")'s [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink").
Empire's must link to these planets from other continents to gain
access.

The Neural Continents are:

- [Cyssor](Cyssor.md "wikilink")
- [Ishundar](Ishundar.md "wikilink")
- [Searhus](Searhus.md "wikilink")
- [Oshur Battle Islands](Oshur.md "wikilink")

The words Planet and Continent are sometimes interchangable.
