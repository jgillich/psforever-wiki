A **Neutral Continent** (or Neutral Planet in the
[Post-Bending](The_Bending.md) era) is simply a
[planet](planet.md) which does not possesses a direct link to an
[Empire](Empire.md)'s [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md).
Empire's must link to these planets from other continents to gain
access.

The Neural Continents are:

- [Cyssor](Cyssor.md)
- [Ishundar](Ishundar.md)
- [Searhus](Searhus.md)
- [Oshur Battle Islands](Oshur.md)

The words Planet and Continent are sometimes interchangable.
