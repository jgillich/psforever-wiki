**T-REK**

The [T-REK](T.$1.md "wikilink") is a modified Remote Electronics Kit
([REK](REK.md "wikilink")), only usable by those with the [Data
Corruption](Data_Corruption.md "wikilink") or [Electronics
Expert](Electronics_Expert.md "wikilink")
[certifications](certification.md "wikilink").

The T-REK is, opposed to the normal REK, a far more offensive type of
equipment. The T-REK's abilities are aimed at crippling the enemy forces
in a variety of ways. It can upload viruses into the [Main
Terminal](Main_Terminal.md "wikilink") of an enemy
[Facility](Facility.md "wikilink") causing certain benefits of that
Facility to be temporarily lost, it can disrupt enemy
[vehicles](vehicle.md "wikilink") causing certain problems like reduced
speed and handling or inverted controls (left becomes right, and vice
versa) and it can even turn an [Empires](Empire.md "wikilink") own
equipment against it.

There are 5 different types of [viruses](virus.md "wikilink") that can be
uploaded into an enemy Facility through its Main Terminal (<i>see
[Virus](Virus.md "wikilink") for more information</i>). Viruses will last
for the their duration unless an enemy [Expert
Hacker](Expert_Hacking.md "wikilink") or [Electronics
Expert](Electronics_Expert.md "wikilink") removes the virus.

It will take 30 seconds after the virus has been uploaded for the
enemies to be alerted. Once that happens, all warning lights in the
Facility will start flashing green, covering the interior of the base in
an eery glow.

The T-REK is also capable of infecting enemy equipment with a virus,
turning it against their former owners. The following equipment can be
infected so that it will hinder the enemy instead of helping them:

- Enemy [Spitfire Turrets](Spitfire_Turret.md "wikilink") and [Wall
  Turrets](Wall_Turret.md "wikilink") can be infected, causing them to
  attack their own Empire
- Enemy [Aegis Shield Generators](Aegis_Shield_Generator.md "wikilink")
  can be infected so that they emit a [Pain
  Field](Pain_Field.md "wikilink")
- Enemy [Motion Sensors](Motion_Sensor.md "wikilink") can be infected
  causing them to display friendly units as enemies on radar.

The primary fire of the T-REK contains 4 shots (similar to the
[Decimator](Decimator.md "wikilink")) that will disrupt enemy
[vehicles](vehicle.md "wikilink") which can cause a number of effects;

- Vehicle speed is reduced
- Decreased handling
