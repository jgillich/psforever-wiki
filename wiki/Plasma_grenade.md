**Plasma Grenade**

The damage caused by **Plasma grenades** depends on the method of
delivery. Both methods inflict damage by splashing
[Plasma](Plasma.md) in an area effect. Affected objects continue
to burn over a short period of time after the initial impact blast.

The [Hand grenade](Hand_grenade.md) version (comes in packs of
three) does more damage than its box ammo counterpart (comes in boxes of
12 rounds), the latter used in the [Punisher](Punisher.md) and
[Thumper](Thumper.md). Thus if using hand grenades, plasma
grenades are better against infantry than [Fragmentation
grenades](Fragmentation_grenade.md). However, when using the box
ammunition, the plasma grenades do significantly less damage. In this
case the fragmentation grenades do more damage to all objects, including
[MAXes](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) and infantry.

The [Plasma](Plasma.md) will also reveal cloakers in the area as
one can see the plasma burning on them even while cloaked, and thus can
be a useful way of revealing cloakers without using the
[Darklight](Darklight.md) [Implant](Implants.md).
