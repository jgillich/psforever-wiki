Cavern lock is granted to an empire when they completely control an
active Core [Cavern](Caverns.md "wikilink") by having posession of all
cavern [Facilities](Facilities.md "wikilink").

**Cavern lock [benefits](Empire_Benefits.md "wikilink")** grant all [module
benefits](module_benefit.md "wikilink") to any
[facilities](facilities.md "wikilink") linked to the cavern via a
[geowarp](geowarp.md "wikilink").

These benefits will remain until the cavern is either unlocked or
becomes inactive.
