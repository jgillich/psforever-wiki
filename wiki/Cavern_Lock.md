Cavern lock is granted to an empire when they completely control an
active Core [Cavern](/Caverns "wikilink") by having posession of all
cavern [Facilities](/Facilities "wikilink").

**Cavern lock [benefits](/Empire_Benefits "wikilink")** grant all [module
benefits](/module_benefit "wikilink") to any
[facilities](/facilities "wikilink") linked to the cavern via a
[geowarp](/geowarp "wikilink").

These benefits will remain until the cavern is either unlocked or
becomes inactive.
