Cavern lock is granted to an empire when they completely control an
active Core [Cavern](Caverns.md) by having posession of all
cavern [Facilities](Facilities.md).

**Cavern lock [benefits](Empire_Benefits.md)** grant all [module
benefits](module_benefit.md) to any
[facilities](Facilities.md) linked to the cavern via a
[geowarp](Geowarp.md).

These benefits will remain until the cavern is either unlocked or
becomes inactive.
