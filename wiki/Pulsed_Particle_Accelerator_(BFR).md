**Pulsed Particle Accelerator**

The Pulsed Particle Accelerator serves the
[Aphelion](Aphelion.md "wikilink") and [Eclipse](Eclipse.md "wikilink") as a
primarily Anti-Vehicular weapon. It is an adaptation of the
[Magrider](Magrider.md "wikilink")'s forward facing light PPA, but it
charges particles longer and is attuned to lower frequencies for better
punch through heavily armored targets. The weapon's particles dissipate
after medium distance travel, but makes up for that with consistent
energy damage throughout its range and direct-fire trajectory. While
extremely effective on vehicles and low flying/hovering aircraft, the
PPA is not very effective on light infantry.
