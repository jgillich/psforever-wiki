Empire Incentives are awarded and adjusted based upon
continental/planetary population. They activate only when the
[empire](Empire.md) with the highest population on the
[zone](Zone.md) has at least 50 players.

For each zone, you have experience, spawn timer, and purchase timer
bonuses. These only affect the current zone and are based on that zone's
population levels. If the dominating empire does not have at least 50
players on the zone, no zone bonuses are given. So for example, if
[VS](Vanu_Sovereignty.md) have 95% of the zone with 46 players and
[NC](New_Conglomerate.md) has 5% with 4 players, that single player doesn't
get a bonus because VS only have 46 players, which is 4 short of 50!

If the dominating empire has over 50 players, then the bonus is
calculated from a percentage level based on the ratio between the high
empire and your empire. The percentage levels and bonuses are:

The "Fractional Imbalance" = your empire / high empire. So if NC has 150
players, your [TR](Terran_Republic.md) empire has 90 players, and VS has
anywhere under 150, you are 90/150 = 60%. You are in the region between
51% and 85%. That means you get 15% experience bonus, 20% faster
respawn, and 20% faster purchase timers. This is only on your current
zone though!

And remember, your [world experience
bonus](Global_Incentives.md) is added. So in that example if
your zone experience bonus is 15% and your world bonus is 50%, you
actually get 65% more experience on that zone.
