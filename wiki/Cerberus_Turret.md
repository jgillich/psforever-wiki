**Cerberus Turret**

The Cerberus Turret is deployed using the [ACE](ACE.md "wikilink")'s
Tertiary Mode. The "Change Ammunition" function will allow you to select
the Cerberus Turret, the [Spitfire
Turret](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Spitfire_Turret "wikilink") or the
[Shadow Turret](Shadow_Turret.md "wikilink").

The maximum amount of Cerberus Turrets that can be placed at any given
time is 5, and they count towards the maximum amount of deployed Turrets
along with the Spitfire and Shadow Turrets.

Cerberus Turrets are the Anti-Aircraft version of the Spitfire, and are
designed to damage/destroy Aircraft. Aircraft that fly past them will
not be destroyed, hovering or flying slow near one of these Turrets will
make you "land" rather fast however.

The Cerberus Turret doesn't do a lot of damage to
[vehicles](vehicle.md "wikilink") and Infantry, and will not fire upon
Infantry unless fired upon.

These Turrets cannot be deployed inside an Enemy [SOI](SOI.md "wikilink").

Kills made with these turrets count towards both the [Air
Defender](Air_Defender.md "wikilink") and
[Engineering](<Engineering_(Merit)> "wikilink")
[Merits](Merit.md "wikilink").
