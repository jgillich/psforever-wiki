**NTU Siphon**

The NTU Siphon is a [BFR](BattleFrame_Robotics.md) pilot weapon. While each
empire has their own unique NTU Siphon model, they function identically.

The NTU Siphon has two modes. The first draws [NTUs](NTU.md)
from active [Warpgates](Warpgate.md) or enemy [NTU
Silos](NTU_Silo.md). The Siphon can only drain a silo to 50%
NTUs, although if anything is damaged in the base, the silo will show
40%. Attempting to drain a silo beyond this level will have no effect.
You can also refill friendly NTU Silos in this mode, assuming you have
filled your capacitor. Similar to an [ANT](Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md), you will
recieve [BEP](BEP.md) for filling friendly silos. For every 2
NTUs you siphon, only 1 unit can be put back into a friendly base. A BFR
with two full siphons can fill a base to approximately 30%. A BFR can
only use one NTU Siphon at a time, but can equip Siphons on both arms.

The second mode is the [EMP](EMP.md) mode. The Siphon must have
at least 30 NTUs gathered in the primary mode to use as an EMP. When
activated, an EMP is expelled (identical to one called by a
[CUD](CUD.md)). An EMP can only be expelled every 20 seconds or
so.

[Jammer Grenades](Jammer_Grenade.md) and EMP blasts will disable
the NTU Siphon completely for a short time (unlike traditional BFR
weapons that simply receive rate of fire penalties).

Uses for this weapon include draining enemy NTUs to drain the base
quicker, using the [EMP](EMP.md) to clear mines, and using the
[EMP](EMP.md) in conjuction with an [Armor
Siphon](Armor_Siphon.md) to attack enemy [BFRs](BattleFrame_Robotics.md).
