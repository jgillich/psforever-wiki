Version 3.12.23 (June 14th 2007)

- [One-Manned Field Turrets](One.$1.md "wikilink") have
  been re-enabled
- Deconstructing a manned Field Turret will now eject the gunner and
  deconstruct the turret correctly. This should prevent an adverse
  side effect that could crash a [zone](zone.md "wikilink").
- Some [HUD](HUD.md "wikilink") elements that had problems when being
  resized have been fixed.
- Kills with the [Wasp](Wasp.md "wikilink") should now count towards the
  [Cavalry Pilot](Cavalry_Pilot.md "wikilink") [merit](merit.md "wikilink")
  awards.
