Character is the common term referring to a playable participant in the
game [PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md).

Other terms: toon, char, avatar, alt.

Each human player controls one character for the duration of their
session in-game.

Characters can be viewed from First Person or Third person perspectives,
and are usually controlled via the traditional means utilized in other
First Person Shooters: the keyboard and mouse.

Each character has a customizable appearance, name, and affiliation.
Each [PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md)/Station ([SOE](Sony_Online_Entertainment.md))
account may create as many as twenty-four characters on the PlanetSide
[Server](Server.md).
