**Router**

The **Router** is a [deployable](deploy.md "wikilink") teleporter system
similar to the [Teleporters](Teleporter.md "wikilink") of the caverns. The
Router will allow friends (and foes) to utilize its teleporter beam to
instantly move between where the [Telepad](Telepad.md "wikilink") is
deployed and the Router.

The Telepad is acquired from a terminal in the back and takes up a
pistol slot. The Telepad is simple to deploy, simply push the button of
its holster and click where you wish to deploy it. The Telepad can only
be deployed within a limited range of the Router (300 meters). One
minute after you click, the Telepad will become operational allowing
non-[IFF](IFF.md "wikilink") transport. To let others take telepads from
your Router, set the [trunk](trunk.md "wikilink") to empire or group.
Placing a telepad renders any active telepads from the same Router
inactive, so be careful who you let have access.

Like most other vehicles, the Router will automatically deconstruct
after five minutes if it loses ownership.

Despite being an [Ancient Tech](Ancient_Tech.md "wikilink") vehicle, the
Router can be spawned anywhere an [AMS](AMS.md "wikilink") can (does not
require a [Vehicle Module](Vehicle_Module.md "wikilink") or [Cavern
Lock](Cavern_Lock.md "wikilink")). Similar to an [AMS](AMS.md "wikilink"), you
can gain [Support Experience
Points](Support_Experience_Points.md "wikilink") by owning a deployed
Router (or deploying a [Telepad](Telepad.md "wikilink") for one) that
friendlies use and then go on to score kills.

The Router can be loaded in a [Lodestar](Lodestar.md "wikilink"), but you
must drive it in sideways (after you lower the gate, turn and strafe
your way in) to work. The router, like all [Ancient
Tech](Ancient_Tech.md "wikilink") vehicles, can travel over water (but
cannot deploy on water). Due to its small saucer-like cross section and
relatively heavy armor, the router can be difficult to destroy.
