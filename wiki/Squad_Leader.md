The [Squad Leader](Squad_Leader.md "wikilink") is the current leader of a
[squad](squad.md "wikilink").

When the leader has higher [Command Ranks](Command_Rank.md "wikilink") they
are able to help the squad accomplish its goal faster and better through
the use of extra command abilities, such as Reveal Enemies, Squad
Waypoints, and more.

The [Squad Leader](Squad_Leader.md "wikilink") always has the number 1
within a [squad](squad.md "wikilink") and is the only
[squad](squad.md "wikilink") member capable of initiating or accepting
[platoon](platoon.md "wikilink") invites.

The Squad Leader gains [Battle Experience
Points](Battle_Experience_Points.md "wikilink") for kills as any other
member of the squad, but gains [Command Experience
Points](Command_Experience_Points.md "wikilink") instead of Battle
Experience during [facility](facility.md "wikilink") captures. Only the
squad leader gains CEP in this way; all other squad members gain BEP
during captures, as normal.

The Squad Leader also has access to list the squad in the players menu
with a custom title, set requirements for each squad position, and view
the [certifications](certifications.md "wikilink") of each member of the
squad. They are also the only member of the squad allowed to access the
[Main Console](Main_Console.md "wikilink") at bases.
