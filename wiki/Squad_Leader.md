The [Squad Leader](/Squad_Leader "wikilink") is the current leader of a
[squad](/squad "wikilink").

When the leader has higher [Command Ranks](/Command_Rank "wikilink") they
are able to help the squad accomplish its goal faster and better through
the use of extra command abilities, such as Reveal Enemies, Squad
Waypoints, and more.

The [Squad Leader](/Squad_Leader "wikilink") always has the number 1
within a [squad](/squad "wikilink") and is the only
[squad](/squad "wikilink") member capable of initiating or accepting
[platoon](/platoon "wikilink") invites.

The Squad Leader gains [Battle Experience
Points](/Battle_Experience_Points "wikilink") for kills as any other
member of the squad, but gains [Command Experience
Points](/Command_Experience_Points "wikilink") instead of Battle
Experience during [facility](/facility "wikilink") captures. Only the
squad leader gains CEP in this way; all other squad members gain BEP
during captures, as normal.

The Squad Leader also has access to list the squad in the players menu
with a custom title, set requirements for each squad position, and view
the [certifications](/certifications "wikilink") of each member of the
squad. They are also the only member of the squad allowed to access the
[Main Console](/Main_Console "wikilink") at bases.
