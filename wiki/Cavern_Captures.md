A cavern capture is part of the [BFR Imprint](BFR_Imprint.md "wikilink")
process.

In order to get a cavern capture, one must be inside the
[SOI](SOI.md "wikilink") of a [cavern](caverns.md "wikilink") facility at the
time of capture if the base is worth (at the time of this writing) 450
[BEP](Battle_Experience_Points.md "wikilink") or
[CEP](Command_Experience_Points.md "wikilink"). Resecures also count if
they are worth 450 BEP or CEP, but a resecure can only count towards the
cavern capture requirement every 20 minutes.

If a cavern capture is awarded, the HUD displays a message alerting the
player to the capture.

Beware: If you are killed right before the time of capture, do not
respawn. Wait until after the capture to click your respawn button, or
else you will not be awarded the capture.
