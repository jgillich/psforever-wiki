There were once ten [continents](Continent.md) on a single
planet named [Auraxis](Auraxis.md), but after [The
Bending](The_Bending.md), these continents were pushed through
dimensional rifts outward into the galaxy to ten unique planets. These
planets, and their continents, remain connected to one another through
the [Galactic Lattice](Galactic_Lattice.md).

Capturing these planets is the main objective of the Auraxian Civil War.
There are two types, [Home Planets](Home_Continent.md) and
[Neutral Planets](Neutral_Continent.md). Each type of planet
provides an [Empire Benefit](Empire_Benefit.md) should a faction
manage to [capture](Continental_lock.md) it.

Each continent, and the planet it is located on, can be reached by
traveling through a continent's [warpgates](Warpgate.md) or
[broadcast warpgates](broadcast_warpgate.md), or via the [HART
Shuttle](HART.md) system located in each Empire's
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md). It can also be reached by selecting
[Instant Action](Instant_Action.md) from your Esc
[Menu](Menu.md).

Each Planet and its status can be viewed from the [Interstellar
Map](Interstellar_Map.md).
