There were once ten [continents](/continent "wikilink") on a single
planet named [Auraxis](/Auraxis "wikilink"), but after [The
Bending](/The_Bending "wikilink"), these continents were pushed through
dimensional rifts outward into the galaxy to ten unique planets. These
planets, and their continents, remain connected to one another through
the [Galactic Lattice](/Galactic_Lattice "wikilink").

Capturing these planets is the main objective of the Auraxian Civil War.
There are two types, [Home Planets](/Home_Continent "wikilink") and
[Neutral Planets](/Neutral_Continent "wikilink"). Each type of planet
provides an [Empire Benefit](/Empire_Benefit "wikilink") should a faction
manage to [capture](/Continental_lock "wikilink") it.

Each continent, and the planet it is located on, can be reached by
traveling through a continent's [warpgates](/warpgate "wikilink") or
[broadcast warpgates](/broadcast_warpgate "wikilink"), or via the [HART
Shuttle](/HART "wikilink") system located in each Empire's
[Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink"). It can also be reached by selecting
[Instant Action](/Instant_Action "wikilink") from your Esc
[Menu](/Menu "wikilink").

Each Planet and its status can be viewed from the [Interstellar
Map](/Interstellar_Map "wikilink").
