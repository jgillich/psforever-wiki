There were once ten [continents](continent.md "wikilink") on a single
planet named [Auraxis](Auraxis.md "wikilink"), but after [The
Bending](The_Bending.md "wikilink"), these continents were pushed through
dimensional rifts outward into the galaxy to ten unique planets. These
planets, and their continents, remain connected to one another through
the [Galactic Lattice](Galactic_Lattice.md "wikilink").

Capturing these planets is the main objective of the Auraxian Civil War.
There are two types, [Home Planets](Home_Continent.md "wikilink") and
[Neutral Planets](Neutral_Continent.md "wikilink"). Each type of planet
provides an [Empire Benefit](Empire_Benefit.md "wikilink") should a faction
manage to [capture](Continental_lock.md "wikilink") it.

Each continent, and the planet it is located on, can be reached by
traveling through a continent's [warpgates](warpgate.md "wikilink") or
[broadcast warpgates](broadcast_warpgate.md "wikilink"), or via the [HART
Shuttle](HART.md "wikilink") system located in each Empire's
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink"). It can also be reached by selecting
[Instant Action](Instant_Action.md "wikilink") from your Esc
[Menu](Menu.md "wikilink").

Each Planet and its status can be viewed from the [Interstellar
Map](Interstellar_Map.md "wikilink").
