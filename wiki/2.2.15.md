Version [2.2.15](/2.2.15 "wikilink") (November 25, 2003)

- Resolved some [server](/server "wikilink") crash issues.
- [Animation Culling](/Animation_Culling "wikilink") is less
  aggressive. This should cause animations to move smoother, even in
  heavy combat situations.
- Tweaked [backpack](/backpack "wikilink") cleanup code so they will
  not cleanup as fast in heavy combat.
