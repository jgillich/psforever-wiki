"**Hack-and-Hold**" refers to [facilities](Facility.md "wikilink") that, in
order to be captured, must be [hacked](hack.md "wikilink") and the owning
[Empire](Empire.md "wikilink") prevented from re-hacking (resecuring) the
facility for 15 minutes. [Cavern](Cavern.md "wikilink") facilities are also
"hack-and-hold", but they need only be protected for 10 minutes.

This was the original way to capture a facility, but with the
introduction of [LLU](LLU.md "wikilink") facilities, this term was coined
in order to distinguish between them. On the map screen, "hack-and-hold"
facilities are distinguished by having an icon of a clock on either side
of the facility's name.
