**Medical Applicator**

The battlefield medic is possibly one of the most coveted squad members.
Using the [Medical Applicator](Medical_Applicator.md), they can
heal soldiers in the field. With the additional [Advanced
Medical](Advanced_Medical.md) certification, the [Medical
Applicator](Medical_Applicator.md) can be used to revive fallen
solders (provided they have not released). Two settings govern the use
of the [Medical Applicator](Medical_Applicator.md). The Primary
setting allows for the heal/revive of soldiers in the field. The
Secondary function will allow the user to heal himself.

## New Player Advice

1.  Try to allow the player being healed to stand in front of you, with
    their weapon drawn and pointed away. This will protect both of you
    from sneak attacks.
2.  When reviving, it may take a second to "find" your target. Make sure
    your crosshair has turned green and displays their name before you
    start your revive.
3.  Be sure to check all over the body for a valid revive point.
    Starting at the feet and working your way up can help. The empty
    space just above their corpse and below their name is also a good
    revive point when you cannot find any on the body.
4.  Friendly troops moving between you and the person you are reviving
    can interrupt the revival process. Try standing against a wall or
    someplace else out of the way so that your crosshairs don't rest on
    an area of heavy traffic.
5.  Advanced Medics can see "fallen" friendly soldiers on the [Proximity
    Map](Proximity_Map.md) when their Medical Applicator is
    drawn. They are represented as glowing triangles.
6.  It's a good idea to create a [macro](Macro.md) in local chat
    announcing "I am an advanced medic. Do not release!" This will let
    people know that there is an advanced medic in the area willing to
    revive them, and encourage them to wait for a revive.
7.  Advanced medics should carry extra Health Canisters with them at all
    times. It takes 25 units of health canister supply to revive a
    fallen ally.
