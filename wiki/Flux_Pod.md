The **Flux Pod** is the name of the weapon launcher used by the
[Aurora](/Aurora "wikilink") armored transport vehicle. It can be fired
semi-automatically or in bursts of 6. Each clip holds 12 pods. The
weapon suffers from severe [cone of fire](/cone_of_fire "wikilink") bloom
in semi-automatic fire mode, thus most players use the 6-pod burst fire.
While the burst fire has a large cone of fire itself, it's most
effective at ranges where the [Aurora](/Aurora "wikilink") excells: close
range. Semi-automatic fire is best used at medium-long range, but the
[cone of fire](/cone_of_fire "wikilink") bloom makes engaging targets at
this range almost useless. Flux Pods are purple and are best against
infantry due to their splash damage. Approximately 5 pods will kill a
full-health soldier wearing [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](/Reinforced_Exo-Suit "wikilink") armor.
