Research Room can only be found in [Bio
Laboratories](Bio_Laboratory.md "wikilink") behind the [Spawn
Room](Spawn_Room.md "wikilink").

The Research Area right behind the Spawn Room features a [Medical
Terminal](Medical_Terminal.md "wikilink") and several
[Lockers](Locker.md "wikilink").

Down the stairs is the main Research Area with special Tubes with people
in them as well as some boxes. If the Bio Laboratory is a
[LLU](LLU.md "wikilink") [Facility](Facility.md "wikilink") than the [Lattice
Logic Unit Socket](Lattice_Logic_Unit_Socket.md "wikilink") will also be in
this Room.
