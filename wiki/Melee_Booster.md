The **Melee Booster** implant greatly increases damage output from all
melee weapons, which includes the [empire](empire.md "wikilink")-specific
combat knife (key '5') standard to all infantry (Non-MAX)
[armor](armor.md "wikilink"), as well as the [Fusion
Blade](Fusion_Blade.md "wikilink").

Damage to enemy health points is increased by 25 over that of an
unboosted knife swing, resulting in death in 2 swings (Full health, no
[Personal Shield](Personal_Shield.md "wikilink") implant) if combined with
an empire-specific combat knife's secondary mode.

Typically only used by [Infiltrators](Infiltrator.md "wikilink"), few other
players can get close enough to an enemy for this to be very useful.
This implant has no effect on any other weapon system.

It will use 10 stamina points for a swing in either swing mode for any
melee weapon.
