A Sphere of Influence radiates invisibly out from the center of each
[facility](/facilities "wikilink") and [tower](/towers "wikilink") on a
continent or [cavern](/caverns "wikilink"). Technically, the Sphere of
Influence is a cylindrical shape, extending from the ground to the
flight ceiling. On your [map](/Continental_Map "wikilink"), each SOI is
color coded Red, Blue, or Purple for each Empire that controls it, or
green for [neutrality](/neutral "wikilink").

This area's main function is as a location for generating [Experience
Point](/Experience_Points "wikilink") rewards. Anyone within the SOI for
15min prior to its capture will receive experience points based on the
number and activities of combatants within the sphere. If that person is
in a [squad](/squad "wikilink"), the rest of the squad members on the
same continent also share in the reward.

[Spitfires](/Spitfire#Spitfire_Turret "wikilink"), [Motion
Detectors](/ACE#Motion_Sensor_Alarm "wikilink"), [Aegis Shield
Generators](/Aegis_Shield_Generator "wikilink"),
[TRAPs](/TRAP "wikilink"), and [Cerberus
Turrets](/Cerberus_Turret "wikilink") cannot be deployed in an enemy SOI
(though spitfires can if the user has the [Assault
Engineering](/Assault_Engineering "wikilink")
[Certification](/Certification "wikilink")). [One-Manned Field
Turrets](/One-Manned_Field_Turret "wikilink") can only be deployed in a
neutral SOI and the [Shadow Turrets](/Shadow_Turret "wikilink") can only
be deployed within a friendly SOI. SOIs also interfere with the [HART
shuttle](/HART "wikilink") drop pods. All enemy and friendly drop pods
must descend outside of this invisible area.

In addition, the SOI can detect and display a warning on your Continent
Map if an enemy force of certain size is present. The
[alert](/alert "wikilink") is coded as yellow, orange, or red depending
on the size of the enemy presence.

While players are inside a friendly SOI, they will be affected by the
benefits that that facility provides, as well as any linked benefits
that facility might have. [Module](/Module "wikilink") benefits that are
in place at that facility will also be triggered for players inside its
SOI.

Any player may also use the [/broadcast
channel](/In-Game_Commands "wikilink") within a Friendly Base SOI as you
would in your Empire's Sanctuary; friendly Tower SOIs do not have
/broadcast capability. However, unlike the Sanctuary, this chat only
goes to the SOI you are in, and not the entire continent. When your
empire captures the entire continent, the /broadcast channel functions
as it does in the Sanctuary; it goes to all members of your empire on
the continent, regardless of location.

Facility SOI are "x" in diameter. Tower SOI are "y" in diameter.
