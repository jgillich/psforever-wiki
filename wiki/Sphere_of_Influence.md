A Sphere of Influence radiates invisibly out from the center of each
[facility](facilities.md "wikilink") and [tower](towers.md "wikilink") on a
continent or [cavern](caverns.md "wikilink"). Technically, the Sphere of
Influence is a cylindrical shape, extending from the ground to the
flight ceiling. On your [map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink"), each SOI is
color coded Red, Blue, or Purple for each Empire that controls it, or
green for [neutrality](neutral.md "wikilink").

This area's main function is as a location for generating [Experience
Point](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") rewards. Anyone within the SOI for
15min prior to its capture will receive experience points based on the
number and activities of combatants within the sphere. If that person is
in a [squad](squad.md "wikilink"), the rest of the squad members on the
same continent also share in the reward.

[Spitfires](Spitfire.md#Spitfire_Turret "wikilink"), [Motion
Detectors](ACE.md#Motion_Sensor_Alarm "wikilink"), [Aegis Shield
Generators](Aegis_Shield_Generator.md "wikilink"),
[TRAPs](TRAP.md "wikilink"), and [Cerberus
Turrets](Cerberus_Turret.md "wikilink") cannot be deployed in an enemy SOI
(though spitfires can if the user has the [Assault
Engineering](Assault_Engineering.md "wikilink")
[Certification](Certification.md "wikilink")). [One-Manned Field
Turrets](One.$1.md "wikilink") can only be deployed in a
neutral SOI and the [Shadow Turrets](Shadow_Turret.md "wikilink") can only
be deployed within a friendly SOI. SOIs also interfere with the [HART
shuttle](HART.md "wikilink") drop pods. All enemy and friendly drop pods
must descend outside of this invisible area.

In addition, the SOI can detect and display a warning on your Continent
Map if an enemy force of certain size is present. The
[alert](alert.md "wikilink") is coded as yellow, orange, or red depending
on the size of the enemy presence.

While players are inside a friendly SOI, they will be affected by the
benefits that that facility provides, as well as any linked benefits
that facility might have. [Module](Module.md "wikilink") benefits that are
in place at that facility will also be triggered for players inside its
SOI.

Any player may also use the [/broadcast
channel](In.$1.md "wikilink") within a Friendly Base SOI as you
would in your Empire's Sanctuary; friendly Tower SOIs do not have
/broadcast capability. However, unlike the Sanctuary, this chat only
goes to the SOI you are in, and not the entire continent. When your
empire captures the entire continent, the /broadcast channel functions
as it does in the Sanctuary; it goes to all members of your empire on
the continent, regardless of location.

Facility SOI are "x" in diameter. Tower SOI are "y" in diameter.
