**NTU Siphon**

The NTU Siphon is a [BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) pilot weapon.
While each empire has their own unique NTU Siphon model, they function
identically.

The NTU Siphon has two modes. The first draws [NTUs](../items/NTU.md) from
active [Warpgates](../locations/Warpgate.md) or enemy
[NTU Silos](../locations/NTU_Silo.md). The Siphon can only drain a silo to 50%
NTUs, although if anything is damaged in the base, the silo will show 40%.
Attempting to drain a silo beyond this level will have no effect. You can also
refill friendly NTU Silos in this mode, assuming you have filled your capacitor.
Similar to an [ANT](../vehicles/Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md), you will recieve
[BEP](../terminology/Battle_Experience_Points.md) for filling friendly silos.
For every 2 NTUs you siphon, only 1 unit can be put back into a friendly base. A
BFR with two full siphons can fill a base to approximately 30%. A BFR can only
use one NTU Siphon at a time, but can equip Siphons on both arms.

The second mode is the [EMP](../commands/EMP.md) mode. The Siphon must have at
least 30 NTUs gathered in the primary mode to use as an EMP. When activated, an
EMP is expelled (identical to one called by a [CUD](Command_Uplink_Device.md)).
An EMP can only be expelled every 20 seconds or so.

[Jammer Grenades](Jammer_Grenade.md) and EMP blasts will disable the NTU Siphon
completely for a short time (unlike traditional BFR weapons that simply receive
rate of fire penalties).

Uses for this weapon include draining enemy NTUs to drain the base quicker,
using the [EMP](../commands/EMP.md) to clear mines, and using the
[EMP](../commands/EMP.md) in conjuction with an [Armor Siphon](Armor_Siphon.md)
to attack enemy [BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md).
