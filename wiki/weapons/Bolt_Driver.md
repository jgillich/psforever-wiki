**Bolt Driver**

The Bolt Driver is one of the two sniper rifles in the game. Unless crouched,
the initial [cone of fire](../terminology/Cone_of_fire.md) is very large, blooming out to
nearly the entire screen after a shot or moving even slightly. As such, it is
only useful if you can be crouched and stationary and can anticipate your
target's location.

The Bolt Driver can "one-shot kill" infantry without armor protection, such as
[Cloakers](../items/Infiltration_Suit.md) or soldiers whose armor has been damaged severely, or
characters who aren't at full health. Characters with armor, however, aren't
completely safe, as a successful hit will reduce health by more than half and
remove a significant amount of armor. Enough so that a second shot will net the
kill. (75 points of health per shot vs
[Agile Exo-Suit](../armor/Agile_Exo-Suit.md), and 65 points vs
[Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md))

It is little more than a nuisance to
[MAX's](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md), causing 50 points of damage to
their armor (or health when the [MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md)'s
armor has been drained), and likely not even noticed by
[vehicles](category:_Vehicles.md) and [Phalanx](../items/Phalanx.md) turrets
(unless extremely damaged). The large caliber bolt can, however, pass through
[BattleFrame Robotics](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md)' shields and can do
significant damage to internal systems. The Bolt Driver's shot will damage
different systems depending on where it is aimed. Aiming for the weapons creates
a chance of damaging the BattleFrame Robotics' weapons, the Torso creates a
chance of destroying an item in the BattleFrame Robotics' trunk, aiming for the
BattleFrame Robotics' legs has a chance of damaging the motion servos, slowing
the [BattleFrame Robotics](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md). Finally the
Shield Generater can be damaged by a single Bolt Driver shot, or disabled by
three in quick succesion.
