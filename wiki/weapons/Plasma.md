# Plasma

There are a few different types of **plasma** found in
[PlanetSide](../PlanetSide.md), all of them dangerous. All types continue to
do damage after the initial impact. Soldiers can only take two instances of this
secondary damage at the same time. Additional instances are ignored until the
first one wears off. Note, however, that the damage taken from the initial
impact is unlimited.

## Grenade Plasma

![ troops covered by
green clouds of [Plasma](Plasma.md)](../images/Grenade_Plasma.jpg){ class="figure" }

The first and most common occurance of the fourth state of matter.

Ignited by [Plasma grenades](Plasma_grenade.md), this distinct green fire can be
applied to a large group very quickly via hand [grenades](../items/Grenade.md),
the [Thumper](Thumper.md), or the [Punisher](Punisher.md).

## [VS](../factions/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) [MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) Plasma

These aggravated-damage plasma fields are
[Anti-Vehicular](../certifications/Anti-Vehicular.md) in nature, being
distributed by the orbs of the [Starfire](../armor/Starfire.md) and
[Comet](../armor/Comet.md) [MAXes](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md), as
well as the [Starfire BFR Weapon](<../items/Starfire_(BFR).md>) of the
[Vanu Sovereignty](../factions/Vanu_Sovereignty.md). Soldiers taking damage from this
type of plasma glow purple.

## [BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) [Plasma Mortars](Plasma_Mortar.md)

A Gunner weapon only, these are long-range ballistic mortars intended to injure
[infantry](../terminology/Infantry.md). Soldiers taking damage from this type of
plasma flash white.

## Other

Though technically not plasma, taking burn damage from the [Dragon](Dragon.md)
has very similar effects to plasma and shares the maximum of 2 instances of burn
damage from the secondary fire mode. Soldiers burning from the Dragon will glow
orange.
