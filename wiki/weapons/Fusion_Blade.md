**Fusion Blade**

**Only attendees of the 2007, 2009-2011 Las Vegas Fan Faires and
[Black Ops](../terminology/Black_Ops.md) can currently obtain the Fusion Blade**

The Fusion Blade was awarded to attendees of the 2007, 2009-2011 Las Vegas Fan
Faires. It is also awarded very rarely by Game Managers during special in-game
events. Black Ops soldiers can also access it while they are transformed. You
can acquire the Fusion Blade from an
[Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) under the **Melee Weapons**
tab, and can also be saved under a Favorite. The Fusion Blade will replace an
[Empires](../terminology/Empire.md) Combat Knife and can be equipped from
holster 5. A player cannot carry both the Fusion Blade and his Empire's Combat
Knife at the same time. Fusion Blades are not visible in corpse
[backpacks](../terminology/Backpack.md) and cannot be looted.

In primary mode the Fusion Blade uses slashes to damage opponents, in secondary
fire, the speed of the slashes is increased dramatically. The Sword also glows
(Yellow for [NC](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md), Teal for
[VS](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md), Red for [TR](../etc/Terran_Republic.md), and
green for [Black Ops](../terminology/Black_Ops.md)) and makes a distinctive
sound when in Secondary Mode. The damage for both modes is the same and the only
difference between the two modes is the speed of the slashes.

In both modes, the Fusion Blade will deal 19 [Health](../terminology/Health.md)
and 6 Armor damage to all [armors](../armor/Armor_Index.md) (Full Health and Armor, no
[Implants](../implants/Implants.md) or [MedKits](../items/MedKit.md)).
