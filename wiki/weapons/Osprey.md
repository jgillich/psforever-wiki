**Osprey**

The [New Conglomerate](../factions/New_Conglomerate.md) Variant of the
[One-Manned Field Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret.md), and is deployed by use
of the [Field Deployment Unit](Field_Deployment_Unit.md). It is an adaptation of
the [Scattercannon](../armor/Scattercannon.md)
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) weapon, though lacking the
selectable spread. The [cone of fire](../terminology/Cone_of_fire.md) is also
significantly tighter than the [MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md)
counterpart, allowing for hitting enemies at further distances.
