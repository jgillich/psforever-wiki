**Jackhammer**

The Jackhammer is a powerful, three-barrel heavy assault shotgun. With a larger
magazine capacity than the [Sweeper](Sweeper.md) pump-action shotgun and a
higher rate of fire in semi-auto primary mode, it is very powerful in
close-quarters combat, although its effectiveness rapidly drops off with range.
The secondary mode fires all three barrels in very rapid succession. However,
the secondary mode does less damage per shot (and thus will not kill a fully
armored soldier wearing [Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md)
armor in one blast), and requires a longer delay before firing again as all
barrels must be reloaded.

Shots to kill (Close to Medium Range):
