**Lancer**

The [Vanu Sovereignty](../factions/Vanu_Sovereignty.md)'s
[Anti-Vehicular](../certifications/Anti-Vehicular.md) weapon, the
[Lancer](Lancer.md), feature a fast-moving energy projectile with a small
[cone of fire](../terminology/Cone_of_fire.md). However, it takes approximately
1 second for the weapon to charge prior to each shot, necessitating the soldier
to lead moving targets. The Lancer has a greater range than the
[Phoenix](Phoenix.md) and [Striker](Striker.md).

As an interesting sidenote, this is the only
non-[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md)
[Vanu](../factions/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) beam weapon not to use the universal
[Energy Cell](../ammunition/Energy_Cell.md) ammo.

Shots to kill:

| ---------------------------------------------- | ----------- |
| [MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) | 6 shots     |
| [Lightning](../vehicles/Lightning.md)          | 9 shots     |
| [Prowler](../vehicles/Prowler.md)              | 22(?) shots |
| [Magrider](../vehicles/Magrider.md)            | 17(?) shots |
| [Vanguard](../vehicles/Vanguard.md)            | 23(?) shots |
