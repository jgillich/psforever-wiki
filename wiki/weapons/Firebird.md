[thumb](image:Firebird.jpg) The Firebird is the only weapon on the
[New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md)'s
[Assault Buggy](<../certifications/Assault_Buggy_(Certification).md>), the
[Enforcer](../vehicles/Enforcer.md).

The Firebird is mounted to an open turret and controlled by a single soldier.
Rockets are fed from the trunk of the Enforcer.

The rockets are straight-firing unguided projectiles, equally dangerous to
infantry and vehicles.
