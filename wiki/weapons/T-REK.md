**T-REK**

The [T-REK](T-REK.md) is a modified Remote Electronics Kit
([REK](Remote_Electronics_Kit.md)), only usable by those with the
[Data Corruption](../certifications/Data_Corruption.md) or
[Electronics Expert](../certifications/Electronics_Expert.md)
[certifications](../certifications/Certification.md).

The T-REK is, opposed to the normal REK, a far more offensive type of equipment.
The T-REK's abilities are aimed at crippling the enemy forces in a variety of
ways. It can upload viruses into the [Main Terminal](../items/Main_Terminal.md)
of an enemy [Facility](../locations/Facilities.md) causing certain benefits of
that Facility to be temporarily lost, it can disrupt enemy
[vehicles](../vehicles/index.md) causing certain problems like reduced speed
and handling or inverted controls (left becomes right, and vice versa) and it
can even turn an [Empires](../terminology/Empire.md) own equipment against it.

There are 5 different types of [viruses](../terminology/Virus.md) that can be
uploaded into an enemy Facility through its Main Terminal (<i>see
[Virus](../terminology/Virus.md) for more information</i>). Viruses will last
for the their duration unless an enemy
[Expert Hacker](../certifications/Expert_Hacking.md) or
[Electronics Expert](../certifications/Electronics_Expert.md) removes the virus.

It will take 30 seconds after the virus has been uploaded for the enemies to be
alerted. Once that happens, all warning lights in the Facility will start
flashing green, covering the interior of the base in an eery glow.

The T-REK is also capable of infecting enemy equipment with a virus, turning it
against their former owners. The following equipment can be infected so that it
will hinder the enemy instead of helping them:

- Enemy [Spitfire Turrets](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#spitfire-turret) and
  [Wall Turrets](../items/Phalanx.md) can be infected, causing them to attack
  their own Empire
- Enemy [Aegis Shield Generators](Aegis_Shield_Generator.md) can be infected so
  that they emit a [Pain Field](../terminology/Pain_Field.md)
- Enemy [Motion Sensors](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#motion-sensor-alarm)
  can be infected causing them to display friendly units as enemies on radar.

The primary fire of the T-REK contains 4 shots (similar to the
[Decimator](Decimator.md)) that will disrupt enemy
[vehicles](../vehicles/index.md) which can cause a number of effects;

- Vehicle speed is reduced
- Decreased handling
