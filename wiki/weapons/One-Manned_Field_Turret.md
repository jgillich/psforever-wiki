**One-Manned Field Turret (OMFT)**

The One-Manned Field Turrets are designed to supress Infantry, and deal
good damage against ground and air [Vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md).

All three [Empires](../terminology/Empire.md) have their own variant of the
OMFT, the [New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md) has the
[Osprey](Osprey.md), the [Terran
Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md) has the
[Avenger](Avenger.md) and the [Vanu
Sovereignty](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) has the
[Orion](Orion.md). The OMFTs have weaponry similar to that of
the Anti-Infantry [MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) of each Empire.

These Turrets have Shield Generation, that increases when deployed,
which is similar to the Shields that vehicles have, though enemy players
with [Enhanced Targeting](../implants/Enhanced_Targeting.md) can see the
shield strength.

The turrets have an unlimited ammunition supply reserve. Simply reload
as often as you like to keep your active magazine filled with
ammunition.

Be aware when operating one of these Turrets, for they can be
[jacked](../terminology/Jack.md), while you're in it by only an [advanced
hacker](../certifications/Advanced_Hacking.md). If jacked by an advanced hacker,
the turret will deconstruct. However, if an [Expert
Hacker](../certifications/Expert_Hacking.md) jacks the turret, it will remain in
the game world and will be usable by the enemy.

OMFT cannot be placed inside a friendly or enemy [Sphere of
Influence](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md) or on bridges, but can be
placed within the SOI of a [neutral](../terminology/Neutral.md) base. A maximum
of 5 can be placed by an engineer at a time and share interferece ranges
with [AMSes](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md), [TRAPs](TRAP.md), and [Aegis
Shield Generators](Aegis_Shield_Generator.md). If left unmanned,
they will deconstruct automatically in about 5 minutes.

Kills made with OMFTs count toward empire specific OMFT
[merits](../merits/Merit_Commendations.md): [Avenger Gunner](../merits/Avenger_Gunner.md)
for the Avenger, [Orion Gunner](../merits/Orion_Gunner.md) for the Orion,
and [Osprey Gunner](../merits/Osprey_Gunner.md) for the Osprey. These
kills also count toward the general [Turret
Gunner](../merits/Turret_Gunner.md) merit.

**Graphics Settings Note**: If you plan on gunning these turrets often,
it's best to turn [Bullet Holes](../etc/Menu.md#Video_Options) off in
the graphics settings. Large explosions can leave an opaque black scorch
mark on the outline of your turret, making it difficult, if not
impossible, to see out when turned in certain directions.
