**Rocklet Rifle**

The [Rocklet Rifle](Rocklet_Rifle.md) is a medium-range compact rocket launcher.
Each launched rocklet packs a significant explosion that is equally effective
against vehicles and infantry.

The secondary fire mode fires all remaining rocklets in the clip in rapid
succession. However, this mode is considerably less accurate than the primary
setting and as such is best relegated for use in short to medium-short range.

One of the best uses for this weapon is to clear
[ACE](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md) devices. It can take out a spitfire
easily while being outside of its firing radius. It can also detonate mines with
one direct rocklet hit. When in secondary fire mode, you can deprive a
[MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) unit of all armor in mere
seconds, leaving it vulnerable to other friendlies to finish it off. It's best
to turn auto-reload off when using this weapon, so you can switch to a secondary
weapon to finish your target off quickly without waiting for the long reload
time, as it's rare to kill a
[Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) in one clip (since all 6
have to hit).

## Flaklet

As of the [3.6.9](../patches/3.6.9.md) patch, the Rocklet is also capable of
firing fragmentation rounds as flak that explodes within the proximity of
aircraft. The damage from the flaklet does less damage per round than the
rocklet on aircraft, but its ability to explode nearby without actually hitting
the target can be worth it. Note that when used on ground targets, the Flaklet
does very little damage (i.e. almost completely worthless). See
[Fragmentation Grenade Pack](../items/Fragmentation_Grenade_Pack.md)
