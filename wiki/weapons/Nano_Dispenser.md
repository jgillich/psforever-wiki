**Nano Dispenser**

The [Nano Dispenser](Nano_Dispenser.md) (commonly referred to as the _glue gun_
or _repair gun_) allows for field repair of all "destroyable" equipment, i.e.,
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md), all [turrets](../terminology/Turret.md),
[equipment terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md),
[medical terminals](../items/Medical_Terminal.md),
[certification terminals](../items/Certification_Terminal.md),
[vehicle terminals](../locations/Vehicle_Terminal.md),
[respawn tubes](../items/Respawn_Tube.md), [TRAPs](Tactical_Resonance_Area_Protection.md),
[Aegis Shield Generators](Aegis_Shield_Generator.md),
[Motion Sensors](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#motion-sensor-alarm),
[Sensor Disruptors](../items/Sensor_Disruptor.md),
[implant terminals](../items/Implant_Terminal.md), and
[generators](../items/Generator.md). Just be sure to carry an extra ammo
canister or three for it, as major items like generators and vehicles will use
up much more "juice" to get back up to full status.

With the
[Fortification Engineering](../certifications/Fortification_Engineering.md)
[Certification](../certifications/Certification.md), the Nano Dispenser can also
be used to upgrade [Phalanx](../items/Phalanx.md) turrets via the
[Upgrade Canister](../items/Upgrade_Canister.md) to fire either Anti-Aircraft or
Anti-Armor rounds in addition to the standard rounds. It can also be used to
upgrade [Aegis Shield Generators](Aegis_Shield_Generator.md) with a static
shield using the [Armor Canister](../items/Armor_Canister.md) ammunition with
the Fortification Engineering certification.

With the [Assault Engineering](../certifications/Assault_Engineering.md)
certification, the Nano Dispenser can be used upgrade Aegis Shield Generators to
supply ammunition and hand-held [grenades](../items/Grenade.md) using Armor
Canister ammunition. If you also have Fortificantion Engineering, the Aegis must
have been previously upgraded to have a static shield and the shield must be at
full health to begin the ammunition upgrade.

For each unit of [Armor Canister](../items/Armor_Canister.md) ammunition, a
[standard engineer](../certifications/Engineering.md) using the Nano Dispenser
will repair an object 32 armor points. A player with the
[Combat Engineering](../certifications/Combat_Engineering.md)
[Certification](../certifications/Certification.md) will repair at a rate of 48
points per unit. Characters with
[Fortification](../certifications/Fortification_Engineering.md),
[Assault](../certifications/Assault_Engineering.md), or
[Advanced Engineering](../certifications/Advanced_Engineering.md) have the
highest Nano Dispenser efficiency, repairing at a rate of 64 armor points per
unit of ammunition.
