**Maelstrom**

This is an [Ancient Technology](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) weapon. In
its Primary mode, when fired it extends a "Vortex Whip," a stream of energy that
extends approximately 50m from the weapon and does continuous damage to its
target as long as it remains in contact.

The secondary mode launches a Chain-Lash grenade that explodes on contacting any
soldier or vehicle, then attempts to "Lash" other nearby targets, much the same
as the [Lasher](Lasher.md) . Unlike the Lasher, the lash from a
[Maelstrom](Maelstrom.md)  will hit anyone within (Approx.) 5m of the person hit,
meaning it has the capability to lash all people within (approx.) 5m of anyone
who has been lashed (The [Lasher](Lasher.md)  merely hits anyone within 5m of the
orb itself, it cannot jump from person to person). It takes 5 grenades to kill a
soldier wearing a [Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md). Be
prepared to get plenty of [Grief points](../terminology/Grief_points.md) if you
chain-lash a bunch of friendlies!

The tertiary mode is the same as the secondary, except the Chain-Lash grenade
will explode after 3 seconds or upon contacting an enemy. This will allow its
user to bounce Chain-Lash grenades off of walls to hit targets around corners.

The Maelstrom is a powerful base defense tool as the chain lash can hurt an
unlimited number of enemies in theory. The Maelstrom is also possibly the most
ammo-hungry weapon in PlanetSide. It's best used in defensive roles inside a
friendly SOI that has an [Equipment Module](../items/Equipment_Module.md)
installed so that the ammo recharges automatically. If used in other
circumstances, one should carry plenty of ammo for it, especially if you plan on
using the secondary or tertiary modes, as it takes 10 ammo "points" to fire one
grenade.

On the surface, in addition to the
[Heavy Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md)
[certification](../certifications/Certifications.md), the base must have
[Equipment Module](../items/Equipment_Module.md) installed (or the equipment
[Module benefit](../etc/Module_benefit.md) via
[Lattice](../terminology/Lattice.md)) for the weapon to be available at
[Equipment Terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md).
