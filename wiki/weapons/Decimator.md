**Decimator**

The [Decimator](Decimator.md) is a self-contained, limited use rocket launcher.
Each [Decimator](Decimator.md) comes with three rockets. Once these are fired,
the weapon is discarded.

The [Decimator](Decimator.md) has two firing modes. The primary fire is
dumb-fire, while the secondary firing mode has a nose camera. Unlike the
[Phoenix](Phoenix.md), however, you cannot steer it, though you can still
detonate the warhead at any point in the flight path. The secondary firing mode
is useful for scouting medium-range targets or turning what would otherwise be a
missed shot into a splash damage hit.

It is especially effective against
[MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) units and does significant damage
to vehicles, although the relatively slow rockets make the latter difficult to
get a hit.

The Decimator was originally included in the
[Special Assault](../certifications/Special_Assault.md) certification.

Shots to kill:

|                                                |          |
| ---------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| [MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) | 3 shots  |
| [Lightning](../vehicles/Lightning.md)          | 4 shots  |
| [Prowler](../vehicles/Prowler.md)              | 11 shots |
| [Magrider](../vehicles/Magrider.md)            | 9 shots  |
| [Vanguard](../vehicles/Vanguard.md)            | 12 shots |
