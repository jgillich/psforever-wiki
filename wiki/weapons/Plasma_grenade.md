**Plasma Grenade**

![](../images/Plasma-Hand-grenade-Icon.jpg){ class="figure" }
[](../images/Plasmagrenadepack.jpg) The damage caused
by **Plasma grenades** depends on the method of delivery. Both methods inflict
damage by splashing [Plasma](Plasma.md) in an area effect. Affected objects
continue to burn over a short period of time after the initial impact blast.

The [Hand grenade](Hand_grenade.md) version (comes in packs of three) does more
damage than its box ammo counterpart (comes in boxes of 12 rounds), the latter
used in the [Punisher](Punisher.md) and [Thumper](Thumper.md). Thus if using
hand grenades, plasma grenades are better against infantry than
[Fragmentation grenades](Fragmentation_grenade.md). However, when using the box
ammunition, the plasma grenades do significantly less damage. In this case the
fragmentation grenades do more damage to all objects, including
[MAXes](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) and infantry.

The [Plasma](Plasma.md) will also reveal cloakers in the area as one can see the
plasma burning on them even while cloaked, and thus can be a useful way of
revealing cloakers without using the [Darklight](../implants/Darklight_Vision.md)
[Implant](../implants/index.md).
