**Force-Blade**

Standard issue in all [Infiltration Suits](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md),
[Standard Exo-Suits](../armor/Standard_Exo-Suit.md),
[Agile Exo-Suits](../armor/Agile_Exo-Suit.md) and
[Reinforced Exo-Suits](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md), the Force-Blade is a
generally a weapon of last resort. (Default key: 5)

However, if a Soldier can manage to get close enough to use it, it does do a
considerable amount of damage, particularly in secondary mode, with the aid of a
[Melee Booster](../implants/Melee_Booster.md) implant.

Many [Infiltrators](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md) use this weapon exclusively,
as it requires no ammo, and no holster space, only a steely nerve.

Secondary mode activates the powered force edge of the blade, doubling the
damage per stab, but also creating a distinctive and clearly audiable noise as
it does so.

(Note: This weapon is part of the soldier's armor and so cannot be looted.)
