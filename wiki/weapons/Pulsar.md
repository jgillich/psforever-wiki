**Pulsar**

![](../images/Pulsar-Icon.jpg)

The [Pulsar](Pulsar.md) functions well as an outdoor anti-infantry weapon, as it
has a high projectile velocity, and good accuracy, especially fired from a
crouched position. The AP mode means that even MAX units will fear sustained
fire from this weapon.

Unlike the [Cycler](Cycler.md) and [Gauss](Gauss.md), the [Pulsar](Pulsar.md)'s
projectiles will not travel under water. The Pulsar's
[AP](../terminology/Armor_Piercing.md) projectiles are also not as powerful as
the other empire's weapons, but this is offset by the fact that the user can
change ammo types instantly. A non-native user will be unable to obtain the
[energy ammunition](../ammunition/Energy_Cell.md) from equipment terminals.
