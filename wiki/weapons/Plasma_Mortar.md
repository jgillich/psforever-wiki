**Plasma Mortar**

The Plasma Mortar is an indirect anti-infantry weapon. After the initial
explosive impact, the weapon leaves behind a plasma field for a relatively long
time. Anything stepping into the plasma field will take minor armor damage.
Soldiers wearing an [Infiltration Suit](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md) when hit
will be visible similar to being hit by [Plasma grenades](Plasma_grenade.md).
While the initial explosive impact is not as great as the other
[BFR Anti-Infantry](../certifications/BFR_Anti-Infantry.md) gunner weapons, the
lingering plasma field can be used as an area control weapon. The weapon is also
great at causing multiple system damages to enemy
[BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) with no shields.
