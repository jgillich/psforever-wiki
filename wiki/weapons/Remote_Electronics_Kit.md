**Remote Electronics Kit (REK)**

The Remote Electronics Kit ([REK](Remote_Electronics_Kit.md)) is used to hack enemy
terminals and equipment to allow friendly use, upgrade
[facilities](Facility.md) and equipment with enhanced protection
and to remove viruses. The tool may be equipped and used by anyone, but
its usefulness increases with each level of the Hacking
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md) tree.

You can identify what level of Hacking a player has, by the color of the
beam that their REK emits, and the color of the REK symbol that appears
above the players head when they have the REK equipped. These colors are
listed below under their respective Hacking level.
