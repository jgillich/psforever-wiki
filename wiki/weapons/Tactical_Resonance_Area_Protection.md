**Tactical Resonance Area Protection (TRAP)**

The Tactical Resonance Area Protection, or TRAP for short, can be deployed by
[Fortification Engineers](../certifications/Fortification_Engineering.md) by use
of the [Field Deployment Unit](Field_Deployment_Unit.md).

Up to two TRAPs can be placed next to each other. When deployed, nothing larger
than Infantry can get between them. The interference range for TRAPs is pretty
similar to that of an [AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md), so once
you've placed two of them, you won't be able to place a third one anywhere near
the others.

TRAPs are solid objects, which can take quite a punch before being destroyed
(having 5000 armor points, which is the same armor as a
[Lodestar](../vehicles/Lodestar.md)), and will do damage to anything that tries
to ram it. Friendly [vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) will pass through
friendly TRAPs, similar to passing through vehicles in
[Warpgates](../locations/Warpgate.md). Infantry however cannot pass through it.

The TRAPs share the same interference range as the
[Aegis Shield Generator](Aegis_Shield_Generator.md), the
[AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md), and the
[One-Manned Field Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret.md), and cannot be placed
inside Enemy [SOIs](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md). TRAPs cannot be placed
on catwalks, walls or on the white areas that surround Facilities, Towers and
doors.

If enemy vehicles are destroyed by a TRAP, it will appear in the kill window as
if they were blown up by the vehicle they were driving.
