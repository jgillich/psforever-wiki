**Repeater**

The Repeater is the [Standard Assault](../certifications/Standard_Assault.md)
sidearm of the [Terran Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md). It deals good
damage, is relatively accurate and has a 20 round magazine.

Tips for usage - As a sidearm, this weapon is not to be used at long ranges,
however, at close to medium range, it's a good backup weapon. At close range you
can move freely and fire, hitting most of the time, whilst at medium range, you
should crouch and remain still to keep the weapon accurate.

Some Infiltrators like to use this over the [AMP](Automatic_Machine_Pistol.md)
due to it being more accurate, although they cannot get as close to their
targets due to the slower firing rate.
