**Fragmentation Grenade (Frag Grenade)**

The **Fragmentation grenade** creates an explosion and throws shrapnel which
does significant damage to anything within the blast radius. These grenades are
considered anti-vehicular grenades, and as such do more damage to
[MAXes](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) than to infantry. With the
exception of hand-held [Plasma grenades](Plasma_grenade.md) versus infantry,
fragmentation grenades do more damage to all targets than plasma.

As with all [Hand grenades](Hand_grenade.md), holding the fire key longer
increases the throw distance.

three-pack, **Fragmentation grenades** are also available in ammo boxes for use
with the [Thumper](Thumper.md) and [Punisher](Punisher.md).
