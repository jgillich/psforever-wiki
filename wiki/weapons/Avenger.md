**Avenger**

The [Terran Republic](../terminology/Terran_Republic.md) Variant of the
[One-Manned Field Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret.md), and is deployed by use
of the [Field Deployment Unit](Field_Deployment_Unit.md). It is an adaptation of
the [Dual Cycler](../armor/Dual-Cycler.md)
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) weapon. The rate of fire is
similar to a locked-down Dual Cycler MAX. It has unlimited ammunition, though it
does have to reload after its clip has been depleted.
