**Field Deployment Unit (FDU)**

The FDU is required to deploy the
[TRAP](Tactical_Resonance_Area_Protection.md) for the
[Fortification Engineers](../certifications/Fortification_Engineering.md), and
[Aegis Shield Generator](Aegis_Shield_Generator.md) and
[One-Manned Field Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret.md) for the
[Assault Engineers](../certifications/Assault_Engineering.md).

It is as big as the largest Rifle in your
[inventory](../terminology/Inventory.md), and is consumed when used to deploy
something.

Like [ACE](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md) devices, the FDU devices owned by you show as
a different color in the gameworld and on the [Continental
Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md). They can also be deconstructed by
double clicking on their icon on the continental map and selecting to
deconstruct them.
