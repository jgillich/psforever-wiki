This weapon is found on the roof of the [Thresher](../vehicles/Thresher.md)
and [Leviathan](../vehicles/Leviathan.md) and is controlled by the vehicle's
gunner.

The Thresher version is similar to the [Aurora](../vehicles/Aurora.md)'s
[Flux Pod](../items/Flux_Pod.md), both fire distinctive purple orbs of
energy which are very dangerous to infantry with their strong splash
damage.

The Leviathan version fires the projectiles at a much greater velocity,
but lacks the damage and splash effect of its Thresher counterpart.
