Hand grenades are single lightweight grenades designed to be thrown at thine
enemy. They require only the
[Standard Assault](../certifications/Standard_Assault.md)
[Certification](../certifications/Certification.md).

Hand grenades are purchased and carried in sets of three, each trio using a 2x2
space in the [Inventory](../terminology/Inventory.md) as shown below.

## Use

Each unit has two modes. Primary results in detonation on any impact; secondary
mode sets a three-second delay to detonation unless the grenade contacts an
enemy earlier.

Grenades are equipped as any other weapon; to throw, hold down your fire key.
Holding fire longer increases the throw distance.
