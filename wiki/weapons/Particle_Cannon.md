**Particle Cannon**

The Particle Cannon takes mass-driving to a new level, converting mass into
plasmoid energy and pushing it up to relativistic speeds. This is the most
powerful single-shot anti-vehicular weapon in the game, featuring a
straight-line trajectory, yet relatively large cone of fire. The weapon leaves
behind a minor irradiation field that lingers for a few seconds, eating away at
the armor of anything inside.
