**Suppressor**

The [Suppressor](Suppressor.md) is the standard-issue Sub-Machine Gun for all
PlanetSide soldiers (all soldiers respawn with this [weapon](Weapon.md) after
they have died) and the only rifle in the
[Standard Assault](../certifications/Standard_Assault.md) category. Although it
lacks the damage outputs of its
[Medium Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md) relatives, it is very
accurate, having no cone of fire bloom when crouched and stationary, making it
an excellent outdoor weapon for even experienced players. The 9mm rounds can
also go straight through a BFR's shield, damaging the BFR itself.

Shots to kill:

| [Agile Exo-Suit](../armor/Agile_Exo-Suit.md)           | 10 shots                                        |
| [Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) | 15 shots                                        |
| [MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md)         | 58 [AP](../terminology/Armor_Piercing.md) shots |

[Empire Incentives](../etc/Empire_Incentives.md) applied)
