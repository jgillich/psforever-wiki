**Punisher**

The [Punisher](Punisher.md) is the "Swiss army knife" of PlanetSide weapons. In
its primary mode, it fires 9mm rounds (Anti-Infantry or Armor Piercing) fairly
rapidly, although its shifty cone of fire blooms after a few rounds, limiting
its range considerably. In its secondary mode, it can fire a single rocklet or
grenade. A common mistake for new players is to think the rocklet is an
anti-vehicular weapon. It is fairly useless against vehicles, but does
reasonable damage against stationary infantry.

A common tactic used for the weapon is to launch a
[Fragmentation grenade](Fragmentation_grenade.md) or
[Plasma grenade](Plasma_grenade.md) at an enemy, and then quickly switch to
primary mode to finish him off with bullets. Though to do this properly,
disabling [Auto Reload](../terminology/Menu.md#game-options) in the Game Options Menu is
a must as otherwise you will be unable to fire standard rounds until you have
reloaded your [Grenades](index.md#grenades) or Rocket.
