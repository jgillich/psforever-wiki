**Adaptive Construction Engine (ACE)**

**NOTOC**

Key to setting up defenses and used for special operations, the **Adaptive
Construction Engine** is a multi-purpose device used in the construction of
defensive perimeters. A single-use device, the ACE can be deployed as seven
different items by adjusting the firemode selection.

All deployed ACE and [FDU](Field_Deployment_Unit.md) devices that you own will show as a different
color in the gameworld and the [Continental Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md). The
default color is yellow. Each device can also be deconstructed by double
clicking the deployable icon on the continental map and selecting to deconstruct
it.

'''NOTE: The [Shadow Turret](Shadow_Turret.md),
[Cerberus Turret](Cerberus_Turret.md),
[Sensor Disruptor](../items/Sensor_Disruptor.md), and
[Disruptor Mine](Disruptor_Mine.md) require additional
[certifications](../certifications/Certification.md), and cannot be used with
merely the [Combat Engineering](../certifications/Combat_Engineering.md)
certification.

The options are:

## Remote-Detonated Charge (Boomer)

Commonly referred to as a "Boomer", the 1st mode available on the ACE allows for
the construction of this deadly remote detonated charge. Originally intended to
be used as a perimeter control device, [Cloakers](../items/Infiltration_Suit.md)
and other enterprising induviduals have adapted them to be used as offensive
weapons, particularly useful for destroying [generators](../items/Generator.md)
and [Respawn tubes](../items/Respawn_Tube.md). Boomers can be attached to almost
any static surface, indoors or out, and as long as the trigger remains intact,
will remain in position, ready to be detonated. Boomers can be detonated by
[Jammer grenades](Jammer_Grenade.md) and [EMPs](../commands/EMP.md). Friendly
Boomers are indicated by a green ring surrounding the deployed Boomer, and will
not detonate to friendly jammers/EMPs. Up to 20 Boomers may be deployed by a
single Combat Engineer at any one time.

## High Explosive Mine

![](../images/HE_Mine.jpg){ class="figure" } The enemy of many a soldier, this
proximity mine fortunately can tell friend from foe, but that's about it. Lay
and pray is the motto to follow after deploying this devestating weapon. Harmful
to both infantry and [vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) alike, the weapons litter
the battlefields. While not as versatile as
[Boomers](#remote-detonated-charge-boomer) (they cannot be deployed
indoors and cannot be remotely detonated), they make up for it in sheer force.
Susceptible to standard fire, Jammers and [EMP](../commands/EMP.md) blasts, the
weapons are easily enough destroyed. Like
[Boomers](#remote-detonated-charge-boomer), friendly Mines will display a
green ring surrounding them and cannot be detonated by other friendly
Jammers/[EMPs](../commands/EMP.md). Up to 20 Mines may be deployed by a single
Combat Engineer at any one time.

## Spitfire Turret

![](../images/Spitfire.jpg){ class="figure" } The bane of many a soldier,
this deployable turret is a common sight on the battlefield. Set to
automatically fire at any adversary (soldier or
[vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md)), the "Spit" is a dangerous battlefield
obstacle. [EMPs](../commands/EMP.md) and [Jammer grenades](Jammer_Grenade.md)
will disable them for a short period of time. Other methods of bypassing them
include walking (default by holding left shift) and crouch walking (This DOES
NOT work when the Spitfire Turret is inside a
[Facility](../locations/Facilities.md)
[SOI](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md) that has the
[Interlink](../locations/Interlink.md) Benefit), or using
[Sensor Shield](../implants/Sensor_Shield.md). Be aware however, using a weapon
or taking damage (ie from falling) will reveal your presence to the spitfire
regardless of sensor shield or crouch walking, and it will fire upon you anyway.
The detection and firing range of the Spitfire Turret is 50 m. Up to 10 Spitfire
Turrets can be deployed by a single Combat Engineer at any one time.

Be Forewarned, standing near a friendly Spitfire can cause your death as this
remote weapons platform will not only shoot straight at friendly soldiers
standing between them and any enemies it can see, but can also be destroyed by
snipers with only two shots. When destroyed the Spitfire creates a large
explosion capable of killing all infantry in close vicinity as well as damaging
[Vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md).

Players trained in the art
[Data Corruption](../certifications/Data_Corruption.md) can corrupt the
programming of enemy Spitfire Turrets with their [T-REK](T-REK.md), causing them
to shoot at friendlies, rather than enemies. The only way to find out if a
Spitfire has been infected, is to walk into its line of fire, and see if it
shoots you. This, however, is not recommended.

## Motion Sensor Alarm

The sensor net integrated into the facilities is quite advanced, however, the
range is limited. By utilizing deployable motion sensors, the sensor net can be
extended. In addition, motion sensors can detect cloaked and radar-supressive
units. This can be counteracted by the
[Sensor Shield](../implants/Sensor_Shield.md)
[Implant](../implants/Implants.md). Motion sensors can be disrupted using
[Jammer grenades](Jammer_Grenade.md) and Command [EMPs](../commands/EMP.md),
however these will not destroy them. Up to 20 Motion Sensors can be deployed by
a single Combat Engineer at any one time.

If certed in [Expert Hacking](../certifications/Expert_Hacking.md), a player can
use their [T-REK](T-REK.md) to alter the programming of an enemy Motion Sensor,
causing it to display all friendlies as enemies on radar. The next time you want
to boomer that red dot coming around the corner, you better make sure it's
really an enemy!
