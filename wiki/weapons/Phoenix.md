**Phoenix**

The **Phoenix** is the [Anti-Vehicular](../certifications/Anti-Vehicular.md)
weapon for the [New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md). In its primary
mode, a camera in the nose of the rocket allows the operator to guide it to a
precise target without the operator needing to see the target from his position.
The warhead can be manually detonated at any time in the flight path by pressing
the fire key a second time. The rocket is cumbersome to steer and has a limited
range, usually requiring the operator to fire in the general direction of his
target in order to ascertain he will be able to adjust the rocket's flightpath
in time for impact. Also, the weapon cannot be reloaded while a rocket is being
camera guided. The operator is unaware of his surroundings while piloting the
**Phoenix**, making him susceptible to nearby enemy troops.

In secondary mode, the **Phoenix** fires an unguided, or "dumbfire," rocket,
similar to the [Decimator](Decimator.md). This is useful when the target is
visible and stationary or in close proximity to the [Phoenix](Phoenix.md) user.
