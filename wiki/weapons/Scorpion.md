**Scorpion**

The Scorpion is part of the new
[Elite Assault](../certifications/Elite_Assault.md)
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md), along with the
[Dragon](Dragon.md). However if you have at least the
[Two Year Term of Service Award](../merits/Term_of_Service.md), you can acquire
the Scorpion without certing Elite Assault.

The Scorpion is a straight-trajectory "smart missile" that detonates at a range
you lock in. While this primary explosion causes little damage, it launches 5
smaller rockets in a 90 degree spread downwards. These smaller rockets detonate
after traveling approximately 25 meters, causing massive damage. If three of
these rockets detonate in close proximity to an infantry unit, the unit will be
killed. However, if either the primary round or secondary rockets hit anything
before they reach their explosion distance, they fall to the ground and do not
explode or do damage.

To fire the Scorpion, you need to zoom in onto a target, then lock on to the
selected target with your secondary fire key. This locks the weapon to detonate
at that range (you can lock onto anything: a soldier, the ground, a wall, etc).
You can then fire in any direction with the primary fire key. Zooming all the
way out or firing resets the lock-on range.

The Scorpion requires the target to be at least 50.5 meters away before it will
lock on, which the Scorpion indicates. It cannot fire at targets over 301.7
meters away either.

The secondary rockets have a predictable explosion pattern: two rocklets will
always be propelled at a 90 degree angle downwards from the primary explosion.
The remaining 3 rocklets explode at random angles. Thus to maximize the
probability of hitting your target with at least two rocklets, aim to the left
or right of your target so that one of the two predictable rocklets hits the
target and hope that another random rocklet explodes close by as well.

Note that extreme elevation differentials between you and your target require a
little more planning. For example, if you are on a mountain top targeting a
soldier by the water's edge, you need to lock on to an object that is slightly
closer to you than your intended target or else your rocklets will explode
behind your intended target. Similarly, you need to add range to kill a sniper
on a mountain far above you or else the rocklets will explode well short of your
target.

The Scorpion has a rather large learning curve, but once mastered, it's a
devastating weapon.

The weapon has a rare [known issue](../archive/Known_Issues.md) involving the
bomblets not exploding properly.
