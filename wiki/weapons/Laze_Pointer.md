**Laze Pointer**

![](../images/Laze-Icon.jpg)

The [Laze Pointer](Laze_Pointer.md) allows front-line troops to indicate targets
for [Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md) gunners, who will be quite far from the
target. (It is also useful for [Liberator](../vehicles/Liberator.md) bombing
runs.)

The Laze Pointer can be obtained from any
[Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) or directly from a deployed
[Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md).

Simply point the [Laze Pointer](Laze_Pointer.md) at the target and hold the
trigger. A progress bar indicates the time to completion. Once completed, a
temporary targeting waypoint will be visible in the
[HUD](../terminology/Heads-up_Display.md) and on the
[Proximity Map](../terminology/Proximity_Map.md) for members of the Platoon.
Unlike normal [waypoints](../terminology/Waypoint.md), targeting waypoints are
circular on the proximity map, use the color and number of the user, and go away
after about 15 seconds.
