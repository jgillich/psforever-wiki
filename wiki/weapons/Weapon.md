![](../images/Tr_weapons.jpg "fig:Tr_weapons.jpg")'s empire-specific handheld
weaponry.\]\] [Weapons](Weapon.md) are the bread and butter of
the game [PlanetSide](../etc/PlanetSide.md). They are practically
essential to do anything in PlanetSide, as PlanetSide is a war simulator
and weapons are the basis of any war. The weapons in PlanetSide are
highly diversified, from grenade launchers to shotguns to sniper rifles.
Understanding the differences between the weapons is important to
understanding PlanetSide.

Because of the multitude of weaponry available to a player in
PlanetSide, it is very easy to get overwhelmed. Knowing when to use each
weapon is very important, but playing through the game normally will
eventually teach a player which weapons to use in what circumstances.
Every weapon in PlanetSide serves some type of purpose, the goal is to
learn which weapons to use and when and why.

## Acquiring Weapons

When a player first spawns in PlanetSide, they automatically have a
[Suppressor](Suppressor.md), their Empire-Specific pistol, a
combat knife, four boxes of standard 9mm ammo, one box of AP 9mm ammo,
and one box of whatever ammunition that empire's empire-specific pistol
uses. However, to use the more advanced weaponry which is more prevalant
on the battlefield, the user has to go through a slight process.

### Certifications

To be able to acquire certain weapons, a player needs certain
[certifications](../certifications/Certification.md) from a [certification
terminal](../items/Certification_Terminal.md). There are only six weapon
certifications, and all characters have one of them. The six weapon
cerifications are as follows:

- [Standard Assault](../certifications/Standard_Assault.md)
- [Medium Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md)
  - [Heavy Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md)
  - [Special Assault](../certifications/Special_Assault.md)
  - [Sniping](../certifications/Sniping.md)
  - [Anti-Vehicular](../certifications/Anti-Vehicular.md)

All characters are required to have Standard Assault, and Medium Assault
is the prerequisite to the other four weapon certifications. Thus,
Medium Assault is a very popular certification, and almost every
character has it.

### Merits

In addition to this, the [Heavy Scout
Rifle](Heavy_Scout_Rifle.md) requires no certification, but it
does require the player to have a [2 Year Term of
Service](../merits/Term_of_Service.md) to be able to acquire it.
Currently, the Heavy Scout Rifle is the only weapon in the game to have
such a requirement.

### Equipment Terminal

After a player has the correct [certification](../certifications/Certification.md)
or [Merit](../merits/Merit_Commendations.md), they must purchase the
weapons from an [equipment terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md). In
addition to this, when they purchase a weapon, to be able to use it,
they must have the correct type of holster in their armor.

#### Holsters

All armors have holsters in them, and certain weapons go into certain
holsters. There are two types of holsters: pistol holsters and rifle
holsters.

##### Pistol Holsters

The pistol holsters on an armor are always going to be slot 1 and
sometimes slot 3. These are smaller weapons, as the pistol holster is
only 3x3. The weapons that use the pistol holster are:

- All Empire-Specific pistols
- [AMP](AMP.md)
- [Spiker](Spiker.md)
- Hand-Held Grenades

Even though Hand-Held Grenades are fired through the pistol holster,
when stored in the inventory, a handheld grenade only takes up a 2x2
slot of inventory.

##### Rifle Holsters

Rifle holsters are much larger, and the Infiltration suit does not even
have any rifle slots. Rifle slots are slot 2 and 4, and are reserved for
more powerful weapons. These are the weapons that a player will usually
use when in combat. The weapons that use the rifle slot are:

- All [Medium Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md) weapons except for
  the Spiker
- [Heavy Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) weapons
- [Special Assault](../certifications/Special_Assault.md) weapons
- [Sniping](../certifications/Sniping.md) weapons
- [Anti-Vehicular](../certifications/Anti-Vehicular.md) weapons

Although Medium Assault weapons and Special Assault weapons use rifles
slots, they do not take up the full 9 x 3 space. This doesn't make a
difference in the holster, however, when storing these weapons in normal
inventory, they only take up a 6 x 3 space.

#### Ammo

When a player purchases a weapon, the weapon only has the ammo that
comes in the magazine. To truly utilize a weapon, a player needs to
purchase ammo boxes as well. Generally speaking, a weapon needs at least
two boxes of ammo to sustain a good amount of time on the battlefield.
There are exceptions to this rule, but this is generally speaking.

Also, many weapons have two types of ammo: standard ammo and AP ammo.
Standard ammo is white in color, and is designed to take out other
infantry. AP ammo is gold in color, and is designed to take out enemy
[MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md)'s and [vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md). The only
weapons with these sorts of restrictions are [Standard
Assault](../certifications/Standard_Assault.md), [Medium
Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md), and [Heavy
Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) weapons.

The exceptions to this rule are [Ancient
Technology](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) and [Vanu
Sovereignty](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) weapons. The
[Beamer](Beamer.md) and the [Pulsar](Pulsar.md) have an
inherent AP mode which allows the user to switch to armor piecing on the
fly without worrying about different ammo types. The
[Lasher](Lasher.md) and the [Ancient
Technology](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) weapons are already effective
against all type of enemies without different ammunition types or firing
modes designed specifically for them.

## Weapon Classes

There are over 20 different weapons in PlanetSide, but they can be
classified into a few groups of weapons to make it easier to understand.
Each and every weapon has a role on the battlefield.

### Combat Knives

The combat knives of PlanetSide are the
[Chainblade](../items/Chainblade.md),
[Mag-Cutter](Mag-Cutter.md), and
[Force-Blade](Force-Blade.md). Knives are generally a soldier's
last resort, although many [Infiltrators](Infiltrator.md) do use
the combat knives as primary weapons, usually with the help of the
[Melee Booster](../implants/Melee_Booster.md) implant. Also, all knives have
a Force Attack funcion which allows them to become much more powerful,
but it emits a loud sound which notifies people to the presence of a
knife wielder.

No matter what type of armor you're using, the combat knife can always
be selected by using, by default, the 5 key. You cannot unselect the
knife, as it is part of the body armor, and you will therefore always
have it with you. You cannot loot enemy knives.

### Basic Weapons

All characters start with these weapons, as these are the weapons that
come with the [Standard Assault](../certifications/Standard_Assault.md)
certification.

#### Pistols

Pistols are generally used as back up weapons, although
[Infiltrators](Infiltrator.md) are forced to use these as
weapons if they do not use the Combat Knife or the [Adaptive
Construction Engine](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md). Also,
many soldiers use pistols as a back up weapon, since many of them use
the same ammo type as their corresponding empire's [Medium
Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md) and [Heavy
Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) weapons. There are two main classes
of pistols, long range pistols and short range pistols. Also, when a
player spawns, they will have their Empire-specific pistol with them.

Short range pistols are what Infiltrators tend to like to use. These are
the [AMP](AMP.md) and the [Mag-Scatter](Mag-Scatter.md).
These weapons are designed to be close range, so, naturally, the
Infiltrator, as a generally close range class, can use this to their
advantage. Also, many Snipers and Medium Assault users like to take one
of these weapons as a close range weapon rather than using their
long-range weapons for close range combat.

Long range pistols is a slightly misleading name, as these pistols still
are not anywhere near Medium Assault range. However, these weapons can
be used effectively in ranges over 20 meters, which is somewhat
advantageous to Infiltrators, as they can kill enemies outside of the 20
meter [Darklight](../implants/Darklight.md) range without fear of being
detected by Darklight. The long range pistols are the
[Beamer](Beamer.md) and the [Repeater](Repeater.md),
which means the [New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md) has no
available long range pistol without looting.

**\*Note:** The [Spiker](Spiker.md) is also a Long Range pistol
but it is classified under [Medium Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md)
and will be talked about later.\*

#### Suppressor

This is the most basic rifle weapon in the game, and does the lowest
damage per shot of any rifle. The [Suppressor](Suppressor.md) is
incredibly accurate, and can be used for some long range work. However,
generally, if a player has a certification above Standard Assault, they
don't want to be using the Suppressor. A player spawns with the
Suppressor when they first spawn out of a [Spawn
Tube](../items/Respawn_Tube.md) or [AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md).

### Medium Assault

[Medium Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md) is one of the most bread and
butter certifications in the game of PlanetSide. Almost every character
has it, as it is the pre-requisite for [Heavy
Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md),
[Anti-Vehicular](../certifications/Anti-Vehicular.md),
[Sniping](../certifications/Sniping.md), and [Special
Assault](../certifications/Special_Assault.md). [Medium
Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md) weapons are all good in all
situations, but they do not excel in any one situation.

#### Empire-Specific Assault Rifles

These are perhaps the most balanced weapons in the game. They can be
used in pretty much any situation, be it long range or short range.
These weapons are used by many characters due to their versatility, and
are especially newbie friendly due to this. However, even veteran
characters use these weapons. These weapons are the
[Cycler](Cycler.md), [Gauss](Gauss.md), and
[Pulsar](Pulsar.md). While these weapons can all be fired in
fully automatic, this can only be reliably used in close range combat.
For longer range combat, burst firing is preferable to keep the [Cone of
fire](../etc/Cone_of_fire.md) under control.

#### Punisher

Another incredibly versatile weapon, the [Punisher](Punisher.md)
is not as good as the other three Assault Rifles at being an assault
rifle, but it has one major advantage over them: a single shot
grenade/rocket launcher. The Punisher, in secondary fire mode, can fire
a single grenade or rocket, which expands many of it's uses. The general
idea behind the Punisher is to first soften a target using a grenade or
rocket, and then to finish them off using normal shots. However, the
Punisher suffers from long reloads, as a user not only has to reload the
single shot ordinance launcher but also the normal 9mm ammo. Also, to be
the most effective with the Punisher, it is most effective to turn
Auto-Reload off so that the game doesn't automatically reload the single
shot ordinance launcher as soon as you fire so you can switch to the 9mm
ammo to finish off a target.

#### Sweeper

The Sweeper is the most powerful close range weapon in the [Medium
Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md) certification. As a shotgun, it's
use is quickly diminished at longer ranges, but it has a tighter spread
than the [Heavy Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) weapons and can
therefore be used at a slightly longer range. Some players even prefer
the Sweeper to it's big brother, the [New
Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md)
[Jackhammer](Jackhammer.md). However, this all comes down to
personal preference.

#### Spiker

This is an [Ancient Technology](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) pistol
with quite an interesting role. Users can charge up the shot, but the
longer a shot is charged up, the more ammo is expended. However, fully
charged, the [Spiker](Spiker.md) does do quite a bit of damage
with quite an impressive splash for a pistol. Infiltrators tend to enjoy
using the Spiker, as it has a fairly long range and a good damage ratio.
However, careful ammo management is important to get many kills with it.

### Heavy Weapons

One of the most heavily contested and debated about certifications,
[Heavy Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) is designed to be at the
forefront of any attack. It is the most expensive of any hand-held
weaponry certification, at four
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md) points along with the [Medium
Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md) certification, but you still see
quite a few weapons from this certification out on the battlefield.
These weapons are designed to be room clearers and have a very low time
to kill in close range combat.

#### Lasher

The [Lasher](Lasher.md) is the [Vanu
Sovereignty](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md)'s Heavy Assault weapon. The
Lasher features a "lash" which does damage to all surrounding targets
after a Lasher orb hits the ground, an enemy, or anything. This makes
the Lasher quite an effective indoor room clearer, as the wall and the
floor will often lash towards enemies and do damage, even if the Lasher
user does not directly hit the enemy. However, the Lasher suffers from
incredibly slow projectile speed and high [Damage
Degradation](../terminology/Damage_Degradation.md), which makes the weapon
usless after a fairly short range. However, because of the slight lash,
a Lasher user can hit enemies around corners, which allows the Lasher to
double as a weak [Special Assault](../certifications/Special_Assault.md) weapon.

#### Jackhammer

The [Jackhammer](Jackhammer.md) is the [New
Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md)'s Heavy Assault weapon. The
JackHammer is an automatic shotgun with a rather high pellet spread but
a high damage output. It is the only Heavy Assault with a secondary
mode, which is a triple shot mode, where three shotgun slugs are
propelled out of the JackHammer in rapid succession. This is an instant
kill at close range, but due to the slight pause between switching fire
modes, the JackHammer's secondary mode is rarely used, unless in
conjuction with the Third Person camera. However, even without it's
secondary mode, the JackHammer fills it's role nicely as a room clearer.

#### Mini-Chaingun

The [Mini-Chaingun](Mini-Chaingun.md) is the [Terran
Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md)'s Heavy Assault weapon. The
Mini-Chaingun, sometimes shortenned to just MCG, is a rapid firing
machine gun with a very high magazine capacity. With 100 shots per
magazine, the MCG can pour out quite a bit of lead. However, because of
the nature of the weapon, careful cone of fire management is required
for slightly longer ranges, but because of this, the MCG has a slightly
longer range than the other two Heavy Assault weapons. However, to be
utilized the most efficiently, an MCG user must crouch, even in close
range combat to minimize the cone of fire.

#### Maelstrom

The [Maelstrom](Maelstrom.md) is an [Ancient
Technology](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) [Heavy
Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) weapon. The Maelstrom is an
incredibly versatile weapon which has both potential for anti-personnel
and anti-armor use. In primary mode, a vortex whip comes out of the end
of the Maelstrom, which, while it does not do as much damage as the
normal [Heavy Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) weaponry, can be used
if needed. The secondary mode fires a grenade which does quite a bit of
damage and can lash, similarily to the [Lasher](Lasher.md),
through walls and around corners. The final mode is the same as the
secondary mode, except there is a two-second fuse on the grenade, which
allows the weapon to be used as Special Assault.

### Sniper Rifles

Sniper Rifles are the handheld infantry weapons with the longest range,
and are quite useful in outdoor battles. Generally, they pale in close
range combat, but they can be used in close range battle if needed. All
sniper rifles come with an 8x zoom, which is very helpful. However,
unlike other FPS's, there are no one-hit kills, even with sniper rifles,
since there is no are-based hit detection.

#### Bolt Driver

The [Bolt Driver](Bolt_Driver.md) was the only Sniper Rifle in
the game for two years. It has the highest damage per shot of any
handheld infantry weapon in the game, doing 100 damage in total.
However, a player wearing any armor besides an Infiltration suit will
have some of the damage absorbed by armor, so therefore, it usually
takes two shots to down an infantry. The cone of fire is too wide while
standing to be used in long range, so therefore, snipers must crouch to
do long distance damage. Also, a Sniper must practice a technique called
leading to hit moving targets. Leading involves moving the crosshair in
front of where an enemy is moving so that the crosshair will settle
before they reach it and so that, while the bullet is in flight, the
target will move into the bullet.

#### Heavy Scout Rifle

The Heavy Scout Rifle is similar to the Bolt Driver in many ways, using
the same ammo type and having almost the same animations, but it differs
from the Bolt Driver in two important ways: damage and refire rate. The
Heavy Scout Rifle is noticably weaker than the Bolt Driver, taking 2 - 5
shots to down an infantry, but it has a 10 round magazine which allows
it to be fired rapidly in semi-automatic mode. However, the cone of fire
blooms after every shot, so cone of fire management is very important.

### Anti-Vehicular Weapons

Anti-Vehicular weapons are an infantryman's best way to deter vehicles.
These weapons are not designed to allow an infantry to solo most
vehicles; rather, most are designed to simply deter a vehicle or to
destroy a vehicle when many of these weapons are grouped together.
Vehicle destruction takes teamwork, otherwise, these weapons are very
good at deterring vehicles that would normally annihilate infantry.

#### Long Range Weaponry

The Empire-Specific Anti-Vehicular weaponry tend to lend themselves
better for outdoor work. These are much longer ranged, and, while they
can be used effectively indoors, tend to shine in outdoors combat.

##### Lancer

The [Lancer](Lancer.md) is the Vanu Sovereignty's Anti-Vehicular
weapon. This features a fast travelling bolt which does quite an
impressive bit of damage to vehicles. The Lancer has a charge up time of
about a second, which means the user has to lead targets not only for
the bolt travelling time, but also for the charge up time. Learning how
much to lead is a learned skill which takes time. The Lancer has an
effective range of 300 meters, which gives it a 50 meter advantage over
the other Empire-Specific Anti-Vehicular Weaponry.

##### Phoenix

The [Phoenix](Phoenix.md) is the New Conglomerate's
Anti-Vehicular weapon. The Phoenix features a guided missile, which
allows the user to compensate for vehicle movement in flight, as well as
fire around corners and around obstacles. This allows the user to be
completely under cover while firing - a liberty that not many weapons
afford. However, during this time, the Phoenix user is completely
vulnerable to attack. The Phoenix missile will explode after 250 meters
of travel, and will explode on contact with any material. Alternatively,
the Phoenix user can trigger the missile to explode by hitting the fire
button (default: Mouse 1) to compensate for near misses. The Phoenix
also has a dumbfire mode to avoid the vulnerability of using the primary
fire mode.

Because the Phoenix does do quite a bit of damage, comparable to the
Decimator, the Phoenix can be utilized quite effectively indoors against
[MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md)'s. It operates pretty much as a reloadable
Decimator indoors, which means it has a slightly higher time to kill,
but can still be effective in a pinch. It is probably the most effective
of the three empire-specific anti-vehicular weapons indoors.

##### Striker

The [Striker](Striker.md) is the Terran Republic's
anti-vehicular weapon. The Striker features lock on missiles, which
allows it to hit fast moving vehicles with ease. However, to keep the
missile tracking a target, the Striker's reticle must be kept on the
target. Also, when a vehicle is locked on, the driver and all passengers
of the vehicle are warned, which gives them ample time to react.
However, because of the lock-on feature of the Striker, the Striker is
the only weapon which can reliably deter enemy aircraft. The Striker's
missiles explode at 250 meters. The Striker also has a secondary mode
which launches dumbfire missiles.

#### Decimator

The [Decimator](Decimator.md) is more of a short range
anti-vehicular weapon, and is more designed to be used against
[MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) units. The Decimator is a 3 shot non-reloadable
rocket launcher which fires only dumbfire missiles which do a
considerable amount of damage. The Decimator kills full-health MAX Units
in three shots, and, while it is difficult to hit moving vehicles,
stationary vehicles also suffer from quite a bit of damage from
Decimators. However, the Decimator suffers from a huge relaunch time,
which usually means a Decimator user has to use cover between shots.

The Decimator also features a second mode which shows the user the
missile in flight, similar to the Phoenix, but the user cannot guide the
missile. Rather, they can detonate the rocket at any time of their
choosing, which is useful for hitting moving vehicles, since a Decimator
user will often miss moving vehicles.

### Special Assault

Special Assault weaponry is fairly unique, but all of them can be summed
up in one word: suppression. Generally, Special Assault weaponry is
designed to be used as suppression, to deter an enemy from moving
through a certain area. However, each of the three Special Assault
weapons are fairly unique.

#### Thumper

By far the most popular Special Assault weapon, the
[Thumper](Thumper.md) is a grenade launcher which can fire
either Plasma, Fragmentation, or Jammer grenades. The weapon can be used
on explode on contact, which is useful for lobbing grenades over walls
and cover, or on a three-second fuse, which allows the grenades time to
bounce around corners. The Thumper is incredibly versatile, but Thumper
users must be careful when firing grenades, or else the grief will come
in quickly.

#### Rocklet Rifle

The [Rocklet Rifle](Rocklet_Rifle.md) is a handheld rocket
launcher which fires 6 rockets in rapid succession. With normal rockets,
the Rocklet can kill an infantry even wearing a Reinforced Exo-Suit in
one magazine. The rockets also do quite a bit of vehicle damage, and can
be used as a weak Anti-Vehicular weapon. With fragmentation grenades
loaded, a Rocklet operates as an aircraft deterrent, as the
fragmentation grenades act as flak and explode in close proximity to air
vehicles, which does quite a bit of damage. However, it acts only as a
deterrent, as it requires quite a few shots to compeltely down an
aircraft.

The Rocklet has two firing modes: single shot and empty magazine. Single
shot fires rockets or grenades one at a time, while the empty magazine
mode, after a short pause, fires all rockets or grenades left in a clip
in rapid succession. This allows for quicker kills, but the cone of fire
jumps dramatically in this mode.

#### Radiator

The [Radiator](Radiator.md) is an [Ancient
Technology](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) grenade launcher which fires
grenades that explode into a very large pain field. This field slowly
damages enemies, completely ignoring their armor, and eats away at their
health. This*includes* enemies inside of a vehicle, which allows a
coordinated radiator team to kill all drivers and passengers inside of a
vehicle without touching the vehicle at all, which makes it ripe for
hacking. However, the radiator generally does damage too slowly for this
to be useful. The Radiator has two firing modes similar to the Thumper:
explode on contact and time-fuse grenades.

### Hand Held Grenades

These are hand held versions of the [Jammer
grenade](Jammer_Grenade.md), [Fragmentation
grenade](Fragmentation_grenade.md), and [Plasma
grenade](Plasma_grenade.md) grenades which are also used in the
[Thumper](Thumper.md) and the [Punisher](Punisher.md).
These take up a pistol slot, but are actually stored in the inventory
slightly smaller than normal pistol weapons. These can be incredibly
useful, as they can hit enemies around cover and make them weaker, and
lure them out into attacking you in their weakened state.

## General Use

The weapons in [PlanetSide](../etc/PlanetSide.md) are not
extraordinarily difficult to utilize. To fire a weapon, use the fire
button (default: Mouse 1). Some weapons have more than one fire mode,
which can be switched to on the fly (default: mouse 2). If you are
carrying more than one type of ammunition for the same gun, you can
switch them with a slight delay (default: x). It is impossible to learn
how to effectively use weapons through words, but there are general tips
that can be learned.

### Close Quarters Combat

At ranges of less than 10 meters, generally, a [Heavy
Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) weapon is the best choice. Close
Quarters Combat tends to involve running at full speed while firing, and
not worrying about cone of fire. Strafing is important for dodging enemy
fire, and constantly keeping your reticle on the enemy is incredibly
important as well.

### Long Range Combat

In long range combat, [cone of fire](../etc/Cone_of_fire.md) management
becomes incredibly important. Generally speaking, fully automatic fire
is never recommended for long range combat, as the cone of fire blooms
far too much to be useful. Also, at these long ranges, it is important
to remember that gravity does play a slight effect, and it effects the
slower bullets more. You may have to compensate for this.
