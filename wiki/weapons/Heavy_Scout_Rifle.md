**Heavy Scout Rifle (HSR)**

![image:HSR-Icon.jpg](../images/HSR-Icon.jpg)

The **Heavy Scout Rifle**, commonly called the **HSR** was introduced in May
2005 in patch [3.6.8](../patches/3.6.8.md). The rifle fires the same
[Bolt](../ammunition/Bolt.md) ammunition as the [Bolt Driver](Bolt_Driver.md)
and has a 10 round magazine. The HSR does far less damage than the Bolt Driver,
but the 10 round clip, faster [Cone of Fire](../terminology/Cone_of_fire.md) recovery,
and faster rate of fire are advantages in some situations. The HSR also has a
slightly larger cone of fire than the Bolt Driver making it a little less
accurate at longer ranges.

The HSR is free for characters with the
[Two Year Term of Service](../merits/Term_of_Service.md)
[merit](../merits/Merit_Commendations.md). Others may obtain it by purchasing
the [Sniping](../certifications/Sniping.md)
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md).
