**Telepad**

The [Telepad](Telepad.md) is not available through the standard
[Equipment terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md), but must be obtained from
a deployed [Router](../vehicles/Router.md).

The Telepad then allows front-line troops to create an instantaneous two-way
[Teleporter](../terminology/Teleporter.md) between the point where the Telepad
is placed, and it's linked [Router](../vehicles/Router.md).

The Telepad is placed on the ground, and then takes one minute to activate, upon
which the link is formed. Once active, the telepad can be destroyed by any
weapon by hitting the largest telepad fragment at the top. It must be placed
where there is room for a soldier to materialise, and has a range of 300m --
about the distance from [Tower](../locations/Towers.md) to Base Spawn Room.
Telepads also have an interference range similar to that of an
[AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md), thus another telepad cannot be
placed close to an already active one. Like other deployables, a telepad placed
by you can be deconstructed by double clicking on its icon on the
[Continental Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md) and selecting to deconstruct it.

The link is not IFF Aware, so enemy troops may travel back through the link from
the Telepad to the Router. If the host [Router](../vehicles/Router.md) is
hacked, the deployed telepad is destroyed.
