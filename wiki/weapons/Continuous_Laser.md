**Continuous Laser**

The Continuous Laser is an anti-infantry beam, inflicting a steady
stream of damage on its target. The weapon has [Damage
Degradation](../terminology/Damage_Degradation.md) and must eat through any
armor an infantry has before affecting their health, giving it the
longest time to kill of any [BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) Anti-Infantry weapon.
However, the precision of the weapon somewhat makes up for this fact.
The weapon is also fairly effective against vehicles if they are close
enough.
