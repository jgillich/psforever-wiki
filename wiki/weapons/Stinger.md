**Stinger**

The **Stinger** is a powerful
[Medium Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md) pistol. It deals a good
bit of damage per hit with a tight
[cone of fire](../terminology/Cone_of_fire.md), but small clip size. It also
suffers severe [Damage Degradation](../terminology/Damage_Degradation.md) (see
graph at right), making it relatively worthless at targets over 50 meters away.

In the primary firing mode, it fires as a single shot pistol with a tight cone
of fire.

The secondary mode fires all remaining rounds quickly with a very large cone of
fire. You must have at least 75 stamina to fire the secondary mode. The drawback
is that this mode drains all remaining [stamina](../terminology/Stamina.md),
leaving you vulnerable to attack. Thus, you might want to think twice before
firing in this mode. There is a short delay before firing begins with the
secondary fire mode (much like the [Rocklet Rifle](Rocklet_Rifle.md)), with a
distinct sound. This can sometimes give your target enough warning to move out
of the way.

At close range, the Stinger will kill a soldier wearing
[Rexo](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) armor in 5 shots. The
[Eraser](../items/Eraser.md) and [Spear](Spear.md) function identically.
