**Celestial Fire** is an [Outfit](Outfit.md) of primarily
"older" PlanetSide players. The average age of its members is 30+. It
was formed on the [Konried](Konried.md) server on the first full
day of PlanetSide: May 20, 2003.

**Celestial Fire** prides itself on being organized, yet easy going;
mature, yet fun-loving. Prime time for **Celestial Fire** is generally
8PM-11PM EST Monday to Friday, but its members can be found online at
other times as well. The Outfit doesn't specialize in any one tactic or
task, preferring to remain loose and able to try new things. They hold
regular "theme" nights, where a particular certification or operation is
focused on, but otherwise leave themselves open to whatever task will
help the [Vanu Sovereignty](Vanu_Sovereignty.md)

The current Outfit Leader is [Wrathchild-K](User:Wrathchild.md).
He is the fourth Leader in the Outfit's history.
