**Wasp Air-to-Air Missile**

These missiles are used by the [Wasp](Wasp.md). They can only be
fired when an air-to-air lock-on is achieved and does a rather large
amount of damage. The boxes can be obtained from any [Equipment
Terminal](Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
[vehicle](vehicle.md)'s [trunk](trunk.md) or acquired
while in the vehicle from a [Landing Pad](Landing_Pad.md).
