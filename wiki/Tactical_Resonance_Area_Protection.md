**Tactical Resonance Area Protection (TRAP)**

The Tactical Resonance Area Protection, or TRAP for short, can be
deployed by [Fortification
Engineers](Fortification_Engineering "wikilink") by use of the [Field
Deployment Unit](Field_Deployment_Unit "wikilink").

Up to two TRAPs can be placed next to each other. When deployed, nothing
larger than Infantry can get between them. The interference range for
TRAPs is pretty similar to that of an
[AMS](Advanced_Mobile_Station "wikilink"), so once you've placed two of
them, you won't be able to place a third one anywhere near the others.

TRAPs are solid objects, which can take quite a punch before being
destroyed (having 5000 armor points, which is the same armor as a
[Lodestar](Lodestar "wikilink")), and will do damage to anything that
tries to ram it. Friendly [vehicles](vehicle "wikilink") will pass
through friendly TRAPs, similar to passing through vehicles in
[Warpgates](Warpgate "wikilink"). Infantry however cannot pass through
it.

The TRAPs share the same interference range as the [Aegis Shield
Generator](Aegis_Shield_Generator "wikilink"), the
[AMS](AMS "wikilink"), and the [One-Manned Field
Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret "wikilink"), and cannot be placed
inside Enemy [SOIs](SOI "wikilink"). TRAPs cannot be placed on catwalks,
walls or on the white areas that surround Facilities, Towers and doors.

If enemy vehicles are destroyed by a TRAP, it will appear in the kill
window as if they were blown up by the vehicle they were driving.
