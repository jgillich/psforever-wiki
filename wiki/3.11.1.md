Released March 20, 2006.

## Description

Changed the way _/appeal_ works. As previously mentioned, the /appeal
command will now bring up a pop-up window telling you that to submit a
ticket for **In Game Support**, a browser will launch from the game
where you can search for a resolution and/or submit a ticket by
selecting the **In Game Support Tab**. If you do not wish to launch a
browser from the game and would like to do it after your play session,
you can write down the URL from the pop-up menu and visit the link to
submit your ticket to Customer Service.

This change has been made for Customer Service to centralize their
customer service tickets over all the different touch points provided to
you. This way there will be a record of your contact whether it is in
email, chat, phone, knowledge base searches or in game.
