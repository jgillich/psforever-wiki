All of the [empire](empire.md)
[Sanctuaries](Sanctuary.md) contain a unique type of [Air
Terminal](Air_Terminal.md). This vehicular terminal is
identical, in appearance, to the terminals found in most
[Facilities](Facilities.md) except for the logo of a
[Mosquito](Mosquito.md) rather then a
[Harasser](Harasser.md). You can only pull air
[vehicles](vehicle.md) from this terminal, not ground vehicles.
The terminal is also capable of spawning the
[Galaxy](vehicles/Galaxy.md), [Galaxy
Gunship](Galaxy_Gunship.md), and
[Lodestar](Lodestar.md).
