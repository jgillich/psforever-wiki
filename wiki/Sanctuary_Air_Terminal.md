All of the [empire](empire.md "wikilink")
[Sanctuaries](Sanctuary.md "wikilink") contain a unique type of [Air
Terminal](Air_Terminal.md "wikilink"). This vehicular terminal is
identical, in appearance, to the terminals found in most
[Facilities](Facility.md "wikilink") except for the logo of a
[Mosquito](Mosquito.md "wikilink") rather then a
[Harasser](Harasser.md "wikilink"). You can only pull air
[vehicles](vehicle.md "wikilink") from this terminal, not ground vehicles.
The terminal is also capable of spawning the
[Galaxy](Galaxy.md "wikilink"), [Galaxy
Gunship](Galaxy_Gunship.md "wikilink"), and
[Lodestar](Lodestar.md "wikilink").
