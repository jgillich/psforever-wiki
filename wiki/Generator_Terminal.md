The [Generator Terminal](Generator_Terminal.md) is located at
the entrance of the [Generator](Generator.md) of each
[base](base.md). Friendly [Expert
Hackers](Expert_Hacking.md) can use their [REK](REK.md)
to hack into the terminal to divert power to generate a [Pain
Field](Pain_Field.md) in the generator room. The pain field
created by this process is the equivalent of a [Pain
Module](Pain_Module.md) in terms of strength. If the facility is
receiving a Pain Module benefit and also upgraded in this manner, the
pain field has intense strength (3 times stronger than a pain module
pain field).

Facilities with upgraded generator pain fields will display a special
icon on the [Continental Map](Continental_Map.md) and will last
for 30 minutes after the last boost.
