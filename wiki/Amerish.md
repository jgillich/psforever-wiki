## Description

Amerish is a habitable moon orbiting a gas giant so massive that it
verges upon becoming a proto-star. The radiation that leaks from this
giant also acts as a sort of local sun to warm up the moon to bearable
temperatures.

The facilities on Amerish are loosely grouped into two cluster, north
and south. Although spaced unevenly, there are definitely choke points
and assault paths that can be anticipated for tactical use.

However, the four small islands off the coasts can be used for alternate
paths, making for elements of unpredictability and ambush.

This continent is permanently connected to an
[Empire](Empire.md)'s [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md) via a
link with the [Bio Laboratory](Bio_Laboratory.md)
[Ikanam](Ikanam.md), and is the Home Continent for that empire.
See [Home Continent](Home_Continent.md) for the current empire
sanctuary links.

This continent is also refered to as
[Amer](Acronyms_and_Slang.md).
