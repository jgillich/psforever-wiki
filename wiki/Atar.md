Atar is a [Dropship Center](Dropship_Center.md) and the only
Facility on [Nexus](Oshur.md#Nexus). It is in the center of
Nexus, in grids J10 and J11.

It has [Lattice](Lattice.md) links to:

- An always-inactive [Geowarp](Geowarp.md)
- [Ascension](Oshur.md#Acsension)
- [Extinction](Oshur.md#Extinction)

It has 3 Towers that are close to the base, of which the Gun Tower to
the South the closest is.

Atar is a Hack-and-Hold Facility.

Atar is very defensible by the simple virtue of its being the sole
facility on the island. Vehicles can only be obtained elsewhere and
brought in through a [Warpgate](Warpgate.md) - a tedious and
time-consuming endevour for a protracted battle. Defenders also have the
advantage of the bottlenecks created by the design of dropship center
hallways.
