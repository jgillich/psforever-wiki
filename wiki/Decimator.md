**Decimator**

The [Decimator](Decimator.md "wikilink") is a self-contained, limited use
rocket launcher. Each [Decimator](Decimator.md "wikilink") comes with three
rockets. Once these are fired, the weapon is discarded.

The [Decimator](Decimator.md "wikilink") has two firing modes. The primary
fire is dumb-fire, while the secondary firing mode has a nose camera.
Unlike the [Phoenix](Phoenix.md "wikilink"), however, you cannot steer it,
though you can still detonate the warhead at any point in the flight
path. The secondary firing mode is useful for scouting medium-range
targets or turning what would otherwise be a missed shot into a splash
damage hit.

It is especially effective against
[MAX](Mechanized_Armored_Exo-Suit.md "wikilink") units and does significant
damage to vehicles, although the relatively slow rockets make the latter
difficult to get a hit.

The Decimator was originally included in the [Special
Assault](Special_Assault.md "wikilink") certification.

Shots to kill:

|                                      |          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| [MAX](MAX.md "wikilink")             | 3 shots  |
| [Lightning](Lightning.md "wikilink") | 4 shots  |
| [Prowler](Prowler.md "wikilink")     | 11 shots |
| [Magrider](Magrider.md "wikilink")   | 9 shots  |
| [Vanguard](Vanguard.md "wikilink")   | 12 shots |

(The above numbers are taken with full Armor; no Vehicle Shields
applied)
