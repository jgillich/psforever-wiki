## What is a tower

A tower is a small, several story structure, usually just outside a
facility. They all have a CC, 2 doors each on their roof and ground
floor with [IFF](IFF.md "wikilink") locks, and a spawn room with tubes,
lockers, and equipment terminals. There are three types. [Air
towers](Air_tower.md "wikilink") feature two landing pads that repair/refit
aircraft, and two wall turrets. [Gun towers](Gun_tower.md "wikilink")
feature two wall turrets. [Watch towers](Watch_tower.md "wikilink") have no
guns, but are five stories and feature a middle “balcony”.

## Why is it important

Any veteran will tell you that holding a facilties tower is a key point
to taking the facility. They provide a spawn location near an enemy
facility, much like an [AMS](AMS.md "wikilink"). A tower, though in a fixed
location at the edge of a facilites [SOI](SOI.md "wikilink"), has several
advantages over an AMS. First off, it has it's own SOI, meaning enemy's
can't drop certain [CE](ACE.md "wikilink") devices just outside the door.
Also, since it's a structure, it can't be destroyed, and protects
infantry from [OSs](Orbital_Strike.md "wikilink") and vehicles. One of it's
biggest advantages, however, is that it allows access to
[MAX](MAX.md "wikilink") suits, a feature that the AMS is lacking.

## Defending

First and foremost, CE is key. Place [boomers](boomer.md "wikilink") on the
inside door, one each, and an alarm near the
[CC](Control_Console.md "wikilink"). Heavily mine the outside.
[Spits](Spitfire.md "wikilink") and alarms aren’t too useful outside, as
vehicles will probably show up early, and then easily destroy them,
without taking much damage. Mines, however, will wreak havoc on them. A
very deadly combo is a combination of [Disruptor
Mines](Disruptor_Mine.md "wikilink") and [AV](Anti.$1.md "wikilink").
The mines make it so vehicles can't fire their weapons, leaving them
open to a salvo of AV rockets. MAXs should set up just inside the door,
on the stairs towards the CC. If the people using them have
[DL](Darklight.md "wikilink"), they should activate it. Once the enemy is
inside, push hard from the spawn room, and head either to the CC, or
keep pushing the enemy outside. If you can bring in vehicles from an
outside source, do so, or else enemy vehicles will seal you in. Once
they reach the spawn room, try your best to kill them, calling for some
CC defence to help (keeping in mind it's probably also under siege).
Repair the spawn tubes and terminals as necessary. Also keep an eye out
for airdrops on the roof. [SA](Special_Assault.md "wikilink") will be
really useful in shoving back anyone who comes through the main floor.
Just sit on the lower and upper landings, aim at the ground floor, and
fire (after making sure it’s clear of friendlies). Standard weaponry is
all that’s needed for taking out air droppers. However, despite this,
once the tower has troops inside, it’s near impossible to beat them back
without outside support. in a heavily forested area, a
[TRAP](TRAP.md "wikilink") may be able to bottleneck people, but in an open
space the high influence radius makes it little more then a target.
[Cerberus turrets](Cerberus_Turret.md "wikilink") placed on the roof/ground
may help prevent mossies campers, but will do little to stop droppers
and ground forces. Also keep an eye out for phantasm, who can easily
drop half a squad onto your roof with no warning. Shadow turrets,
however, can make a heavily defended roof appear an easy target, perfect
for ambushes on droppers.

## Attacking

Attacking is quite a bit easier. First, bring in vehicles to take out
spits and enemy troops, as well as other vehicles. Once you have the
outside secured, then set up a vehicle perimeter, and start firing
inside once the doors open (until your own side starts going through, of
course). If you have the means, drop on top, and attack the CC, forcing
the defenders to guard from two angles. Once inside the main floor, try
to set up some people to keep the enemy trapped in the basement (MAX’s
and SA is really useful), but send the main force to the CC. If you can
get down to the basement, take out the tubes. Try not to have everyone
run downstairs, lest the respawned troops escape back to the CC. As you
kill people guarding the CC, you can hopefully keep them trapped
downstairs, unable to do anything until the tower is yours, leaving them
nowhere to spawn, and trapped in a [pain field](Pain_Field.md "wikilink").
Like mentioned in the defense section, once you hold the outside, it’s
going to be hard for them to take it back, though you should keep an eye
open for outside attacks, which are your biggest threat. If your on the
outer part of an facilities SOI, or attacking a lone tower, a
[OMFT](One.$1.md "wikilink") can help in keeping people
contained, especially in a lone tower, where both doors can be covered.
An [Aegis Shield Generator](Aegis_Shield_Generator.md "wikilink") can also
provide a good hiding place for unmanned vehicles, so they don't fire on
them if they start to push out, and soldiers can easily get in them and
push them back in. Someone with [Assault
Engineering](Assault_Engineering.md "wikilink") can also place spitfires
just outside the doors, making for a nasty surprise when defenders try
to push out.
