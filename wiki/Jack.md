The process of stealing an enemy vehicle using a [Remote Electronics
Kit](Remote_Electronics_Kit.md "wikilink") (REK) and [Advanced
Hacking](Advanced_Hacking.md "wikilink")
[certification](certification.md "wikilink").

To Jack a [vehicle](vehicle.md "wikilink"), approach it and use the REK
anywhere on its surface so that the word "Jack" appears in the middle of
your screen. A timer will appear, similar to other hacking tasks, after
which the vehicle will change ownership to the hacker, and its color
scheme will change to show its new [Empire](Empire.md "wikilink"). Cloaked
[Phantasms](Phantasm.md "wikilink") and [Wraiths](Wraith.md "wikilink") can be
jacked, but requires the hacker to use the
[Darklight](Darklight.md "wikilink") implant to begin the jacking process.

Vehicles may be hacked if they belong to another empire. [Advanced
Hackers](Advanced_Hacking.md "wikilink") may only jack unoccupied vehicles.
[Expert Hackers](Expert_Hacking.md "wikilink") may jack both occupied and
unoccupied vehicles as long as they are stationary. All vehicles are
hackable, including Empire Specific enemy vehicles that would otherwise
be unavailable to the hacker through [Vehicle
Terminals](Vehicle_Terminal.md "wikilink"), and [BattleFrame
Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics.md "wikilink"), although the timer there is
long enough to make jacking a tricky process. [One-Manned Field
Turrets](One.$1.md "wikilink") can be jacked with or
without an occupant. Nobody may enter a vehicle in the process of being
jacked, and those who try will receive a text message warning that the
vehicle is being stolen.

The hacker will still need to be certified to drive the stolen vehicle
if he is to make a clean getaway with it, although may hop in the gunner
seat immediately and start causing havoc. The original owner of the
vehicle is immediately notified on his screen that his vehicle has been
stolen, and the proximity map icon will change from green to red for all
to see, so getting the vehicle away before it is destroyed takes some
planning.

At present there is no way to store jacked vehicles in any sort of
[Lockers](Locker.md "wikilink"). Also, most empire specific vehicles use
empire specific ammuntion, which can only then be replaced by stealing
another vehicle with a full [Trunk](Trunk.md "wikilink").

[MAX](MAX.md "wikilink") Suits may not be jacked, and you'd be amazed how
badly they react when they get a REK in the faceplate...

(Note: Many strange screenshots and board signatures feature Red and
Black [Magriders](Magrider.md "wikilink"), Purple and Green
[Vanguards](Vanguard.md "wikilink") and so on - this is how it's done.)
