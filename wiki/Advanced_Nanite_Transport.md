**Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT)**

The **Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT)** is used to resupply
[facilities](facilities.md) with [NTUs](NTU.md).

To do so, the driver must first drive into a
[Warpgate](Warpgate.md) or [Geowarp](Geowarp.md) bubble
and deploy the **ANT**. (Default key mapping is 'B'.) Note: If
harvesting from a [Geowarp](Geowarp.md), that Geowarp must be
active at the time.

When the **ANT's** capacitors are full, it will automatically undeploy.
The driver must travel to a facility and deploy the **ANT** near the
[NTU Silo](NTU_Silo.md). The **ANT** will undeploy automatically
when the [NTU Silo](NTU_Silo.md) is full or the **ANT's**
capacitors are empty.

One fully-filled **ANT** carries approximately 150% of one
[facility](facilities.md)'s total [NTU](NTU.md)
capacity.

Caution: Fully-charged **ANTs** have a significant secondary blast
radius when destroyed.
