**Sniping**

Sniping Certification allows the character access to the [Bolt
Driver](Bolt_Driver.md "wikilink"), the principle long-range infantry
weapon. As of the [3.6.8.4](3.md.6.8.4 "wikilink") patch of May 27, it also
allows access to the [Heavy Scout Rifle](Heavy_Scout_Rifle.md "wikilink"),
a weapon with less power per shot, but a much higher rate of fire.

The [Heavy Scout Rifle](Heavy_Scout_Rifle.md "wikilink") is also available
for free for characters that have been registered for more than two
years.

This [Certification](Certification.md "wikilink") is required to obtain the
[Sniper](</Sniper_(Merit)> "wikilink") [Merit
Commendation](Merit_Commendation.md "wikilink") if your character is less
than two years old.
