**Sniping**

Sniping Certification allows the character access to the [Bolt
Driver](Bolt_Driver.md), the principle long-range infantry
weapon. As of the [3.6.8.4](3.md.6.8.4) patch of May 27, it also
allows access to the [Heavy Scout Rifle](Heavy_Scout_Rifle.md),
a weapon with less power per shot, but a much higher rate of fire.

The [Heavy Scout Rifle](Heavy_Scout_Rifle.md) is also available
for free for characters that have been registered for more than two
years.

This [Certification](Certification.md) is required to obtain the
[Sniper](</Sniper_(Merit)>) [Merit
Commendation](Merit_Commendation.md) if your character is less
than two years old.
