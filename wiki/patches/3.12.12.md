Version 3.12.12 (April 20th, 2007)

Make way for the new and improved [Sunderer](../vehicles/Sunderer.md)!

Introducing the [Juggernaut](../vehicles/Juggernaut.md),
[Leviathan](../vehicles/Leviathan.md) and
[Vindicator](../vehicles/Vindicator.md)!

The Sunderer was examined very closely and it became immediately clear that it
didn't have enough fire power. Two guns to protect eleven soldiers through
battle lines??? That's just not going to get the job done. So we've added four
more guns! Two of the four new guns will be mounted on the top of our newly
created Base Crasher and were designed to be empire-specific. This will now
provide adequate support incase anyone gets any funny ideas of following too
close behind. To solve the issue of grunts running along side, escaping the fire
arc of the top guns, we've added small caliber machine guns on the sides. Anyone
manning these guns will be given an increased range to their
[Darklight](../implants/Darklight.md) [Implant](../implants/Implants.md) (if
owned). To round out this new party bus, the driver will now be allowed to hop
behind the wheel wearing reinforced armor, jam mines and jump on the horn if
someone gets in the way. This is one heck of an overhaul!

Here is an abbreviated list of features, but don't take our word for it

- Take one for a spin!
