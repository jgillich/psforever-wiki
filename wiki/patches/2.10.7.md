Live Version 2.10.7 (August 16, 2004)

[Battle Islands](../Battle_Islands.md) are now Live. The [Global
Map](../Global_Map.md) Interface has been changed to accomodate the
new Battle Islands. [Warpgates](../Warpgate.md) now work on a
hybrid system, with one warpgate on each
[Sanctuary](../Sanctuary.md), permanently connecting to one [Home
Continent](../Home_Continent.md) and Broadcast Warpgates connecting
to others across the world.
