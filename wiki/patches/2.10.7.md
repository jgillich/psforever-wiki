# 2.10.7

Live Version 2.10.7 (August 16, 2004)

[Battle Islands](../locations/Battle_Islands.md) are now Live. The
[Global Map](../terminology/Global_Map.md) Interface has been changed to
accomodate the new Battle Islands. [Warpgates](../locations/Warpgate.md) now
work on a hybrid system, with one warpgate on each
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md), permanently connecting to one
[Home Continent](../locations/Home_Continent.md) and Broadcast Warpgates
connecting to others across the world.
