Version 3.6.9, released June 21, 2005.

- Enabled the [Rocklet Rifle](../weapons/Rocklet_Rifle.md) to use
  [Fragmentation grenade](../weapons/Fragmentation_grenade.md) ammo and
  fire them as mini [Flak](../weapons/Flak.md) rounds that explode in
  proximity to aircraft.
- Adjusted the [Reaver](../vehicles/Reaver.md) and
  [Mosquito](../vehicles/Mosquito.md)'s maximum health down 5% to reflect
  the "stealth benefit" of gaining 10% more useable armor by not
  losing control when at 10% remaining armor.
- Adjusted the [Reaver](../vehicles/Reaver.md) weapon systems to promote
  its use against vehicle targets.
  1. Significantly increased rocket projectile speed and acceleration
     to help better hit moving targets at range
  2. Decreased rocket damage against infantry
  3. Decreased rocket splash damage range
  4. Increased rocket damage against vehicle targets
  5. Improved Rocket and Gun default [Cone of
     Fire](../etc/Cone_of_fire.md)

<!-- -->

- Decreased the lock on time of the [Sparrow](../items/Sparrow.md) Max
  and, to a lesser extent, the Sparrow [BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) pilot
  weapons.
- Corrected an issue with the [Sweeper](../weapons/Sweeper.md) where it
  would not damage [MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) armor with normal rounds.
