Version 1.8.8 (Aug. 21, 2003)

There will be a patch on August 21, 2003 at 3 AM Pacific Time. It will include
the following items:

- The [Lattice Logic Unit](Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) now appears on the overhead
  map - even when carried.
- The [LLU](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) will only spawn in one
  location per base rather than one of several random points. These locations
  are listed in the online manual.
- Fixed a bug preventing landing pads at
  [Interlink Facilities](../terminology/Interlink.md) from detecting collisions.
  Aircraft can land on them again.
- Users will not be kicked from vehicles upon changing access permissions.
- The [ATV](ATV.md) certification is now 2 cert points
- Hover vehicles no longer take damage while traveling over uneven terrain.
- New audio sounds associated with [LLU](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md).
- Fixed several zone and server crashes.
- Grammar corrections in various in-game dialogs.
- The [Starfire](Starfire.md) now matches the [Sparrow's](Sparrow.md)
  acceleration and projectile speed.
