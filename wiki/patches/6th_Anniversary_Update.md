Greetings Auraxians! Welcome to PlanetSide's 6 Year Anniversary Celebration! To
commemorate this Anniversary we have a few exciting new additions for everybody!

- All characters created before the six year anniversary update will be granted
  a free respec.
- The [battle rank](../terminology/Battle_Rank.md) maximum has been increased
  from 25 to 40 with a special reward upon reaching 40!
- [Six Year Anniversary](../merits/Term_of_Service.md)
  [merit](../merits/Merit_Commendations.md) has been awarded to all Characters
  that are 72 months old!
- [Battle Frame Robotics](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) (BFR)
  [imprint](../terminology/BFR_Imprint.md) will now be given to all characters
  created before June 18, 2009! Everybody with a character created before that
  date will not have to go through the imprint process in the
  [Caverns](../locations/Caverns.md). Players will still need to purchase the
  BFR [certification](../certifications/Certification.md) from one of the
  [certification terminals](../items/Certification_Terminal.md) in order to gain
  access to pilot a BFR.

Thank you and weâ€™ll see you on the battlefield!
