**Version 3.13.10 (January 9, 2008)**

- The Holiday event has ended. Scavenger hunt prizes that have been
  earned will be disabled...for now.
- All mouse mappings should now be shown only when the mouse icon is
  selected in the keymap settings UI (rather than under keyboard
  mappings).
- [Light Scout](../Light_Scout.md) now counts towards the [Air
  Cavalry Scout](../Air_Cavalry_Scout.md) prerequisites for 2nd
  tier Air Cavalry [certifications](Certification.md).
