Version [2.3.13](2.3.13.md) (December 10, 2003)

- Players will now [Respawn](../terminology/Respawn.md) at a location somewhere
  inside the [AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) cloak bubble, rather
  than in the [Spawn Tubes](../items/Respawn_Tube.md) .
- Fixed several [Zone](../terminology/Zone.md) crashes.
- Fixed a Client crash that occur when closing the
  [Inventory](../terminology/Inventory.md) screen with an item on the cursor.
- Players can now [Hack](../terminology/Hack.md) buildings and respawn in the
  [Core Combat](../items/Core_Combat.md) [Caverns](../locations/Caverns.md).
  [Geowarps](../locations/Geowarp.md) can also be used to exit the core again.
- Fixed a memory corruption issue that occurred when using Offline Training.
- The client will not send 'out of sync' messages when a
  [Lodestar](../vehicles/Lodestar.md) is in the zone.
- Some Server optimizations.
