**Version 3.15.4 (March 19, 2008)**

- An issue with the [Data Corruption](../certifications/Data_Corruption.md)
  [certification](../certifications/Certification.md) has been fixed; players
  with Data Corruption will now be able to infect
  [Spitfires](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Spitfire_Turret),
  [Motion Sensors](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Motion_Sensor_Alarm),
  [Wall Turrets](../Wall_Turret.md), and
  [Aegis Shield Generators](../weapons/Aegis_Shield_Generator.md).
- There is now a chance that a [virus](../terminology/Virus.md) will wear off
  much earlier than usual for infected Spitfires, Motion Sensors, Wall Turrets,
  and Aegis Shield Generators.
- The radar icon for the [Sensor Disruptor](../items/Sensor_Disruptor.md) has
  been reduced in size, especially when radar is set to short range.
- All players will be given an optional certification reset.
