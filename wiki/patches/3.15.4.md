**Version 3.15.4 (March 19, 2008)**

- An issue with the [Data Corruption](../Data_Corruption.md)
  [certification](Certification.md) has been fixed; players
  with Data Corruption will now be able to infect
  [Spitfires](../ACE.md#Spitfire_Turret), [Motion
  Sensors](../ACE.md#Motion_Sensor_Alarm), [Wall
  Turrets](../Wall_Turret.md), and [Aegis Shield
  Generators](../Aegis_Shield_Generator.md).
- There is now a chance that a [virus](Virus.md) will wear off
  much earlier than usual for infected Spitfires, Motion Sensors, Wall
  Turrets, and Aegis Shield Generators.
- The radar icon for the [Sensor
  Disruptor](../Sensor_Disruptor.md) has been reduced in size,
  especially when radar is set to short range.
- All players will be given an optional certification reset.
