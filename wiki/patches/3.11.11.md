Version 3.11.11 (May 18, 2006)

**Update Highlights**

- Today, we will kick off an event to celebrate
  [PlanetSide's third anniversary](../etc/Third_Anniversary_of_PlanetSide.md),
  which is on May 19th. The [event](../etc/Events.md) will evolve over possibly
  a week or more, so you are encouraged to login each day to see what has
  changed. Most of the action will take place during peak (evening) hours.
  That's all we can say about it if you want to know more you'll have to login
  and find out what happens!

<!-- -->

- Also in this publish, we addressed some issues that should resolve some recent
  login problems.
