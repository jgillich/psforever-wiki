**Version 3.13.9 (December 11, 2007)**

It's the most wonderful time of the year! In the spirit of the season,
there will be presents to loot and Santa hats on every player. As
always, you can use a quick /humbug to disable these features.

Also back is the holiday scavenger hunt! If you missed out last year, be
sure to search every corner of [Auraxis](../Auraxis.md) for all the
holiday items. You will receive a special prize for each holiday award
you complete by finding the hidden objects. Each prize can only be used
for the duration of the event, so start early!

In addition to the seasonal update, we have also made the following
changes:

- [Galaxy Gunship](../Galaxy_Gunship.md) armor has been reduced,
  and the [afterburner](Afterburner.md) has been removed
  entirely.
- All buggies now have additional resistance against [HE
  Mine](HE_Mine.md) damage. This includes the
  [Harasser](../Harasser.md), [Skyguard](../Skyguard.md),
  [Marauder](../Marauder.md), [Enforcer](../Enforcer.md),
  and [Thresher](../Thresher.md).
