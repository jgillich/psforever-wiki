**Version 3.13.9 (December 11, 2007)**

It's the most wonderful time of the year! In the spirit of the season, there
will be presents to loot and Santa hats on every player. As always, you can use
a quick /humbug to disable these features.

Also back is the holiday scavenger hunt! If you missed out last year, be sure to
search every corner of [Auraxis](../locations/Auraxis.md) for all the holiday
items. You will receive a special prize for each holiday award you complete by
finding the hidden objects. Each prize can only be used for the duration of the
event, so start early!

In addition to the seasonal update, we have also made the following changes:

- [Galaxy Gunship](../vehicles/Galaxy_Gunship.md) armor has been reduced, and
  the [afterburner](../terminology/Afterburner.md) has been removed entirely.
- All buggies now have additional resistance against [HE Mine](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#high-explosive-mine)
  damage. This includes the [Harasser](../vehicles/Harasser.md),
  [Skyguard](../vehicles/Skyguard.md), [Marauder](../vehicles/Marauder.md),
  [Enforcer](../vehicles/Enforcer.md), and [Thresher](../vehicles/Thresher.md).
