Version 3.11.24 (July 11 2006)

**Update Highlights**

- The [Wasp](../vehicles/Wasp.md) will no longer be available without the
  [Air Cavalry Interceptor](../certifications/Air_Cavalry_Interceptor.md)
  [certification](../certifications/Certification.md).
- [Pounder](../armor/Pounder.md) secondary firing mode projectiles now explode
  when they contact an object or when their 3 second timer expires; whichever
  comes first. This will bring the Pounder grenade functionality more inline
  with how all other grenade weapons currently work.
- Added hack detection. We are currently only logging cheaters; once we are
  satisfied the detection is working correctly they will be punished.
