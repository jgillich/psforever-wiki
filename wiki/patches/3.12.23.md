Version 3.12.23 (June 14th 2007)

- [One-Manned Field Turrets](../weapons/One-Manned_Field_Turret.md) have been
  re-enabled
- Deconstructing a manned Field Turret will now eject the gunner and deconstruct
  the turret correctly. This should prevent an adverse side effect that could
  crash a [zone](../terminology/Zone.md).
- Some [HUD](../terminology/Heads-up_Display.md) elements that had problems when being
  resized have been fixed.
- Kills with the [Wasp](../vehicles/Wasp.md) should now count towards the
  [Cavalry Pilot](../merits/Cavalry_Pilot.md)
  [merit](../merits/index.md) awards.
