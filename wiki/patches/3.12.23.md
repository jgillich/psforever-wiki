Version 3.12.23 (June 14th 2007)

- [One-Manned Field Turrets](../weapons/One-Manned_Field_Turret.md) have
  been re-enabled
- Deconstructing a manned Field Turret will now eject the gunner and
  deconstruct the turret correctly. This should prevent an adverse
  side effect that could crash a [zone](../terminology/Zone.md).
- Some [HUD](../HUD.md) elements that had problems when being
  resized have been fixed.
- Kills with the [Wasp](../vehicles/Wasp.md) should now count towards the
  [Cavalry Pilot](../merits/Cavalry_Pilot.md) [merit](../merits/Merit_Commendations.md)
  awards.
