# 3.15.54

_Version 3.15.54 - Thursday March 26th, 2009_

Greetings Auraxians! We would like to thank everybody for participating in the
PlanetSide [Vehicle](../vehicles/index.md) Stimulus Event; we hope you enjoyed
the changes to your favorite weapons, aircrafts and most importantly the knives.
With this update we'll be slowing things down again and you'll find that all the
buffs have been removed and everything is back to normal again.

Now we do understand that a lot of you may have used up your free certification
respecs over the past few weeks so we have another one for you, to take
advantage of this simply visit your nearest
[Certification Terminal](../items/Certification_Terminal.md) and look for the
Forget All button.

- Everybody has been granted a Free
  [Certification](../certifications/Certification.md) Respec.

Thank you and we'll see you on the Battle Field!
