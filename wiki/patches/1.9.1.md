Version 1.9.1 (Aug. 27, 2003)

There will be a patch to the live servers at 3 AM Pacific on August 27, 2003. It will contain the following items:

- Drivers will gain control of vehicles coming off the creation pad
  sooner.
- Air vehicles will move off of the vehicle creation pad quicker.
- Vehicles will no longer drift when the driver hits Alt-R. \*The
  gunner camera on the [Vanguard](Vanguard.md) and the
  [Prowler](Prowler.md) will now shake much less.
- [Spitfire](Spitfire.md) Turrets will now fire in the correct
  direction to hit their target.
- The link between a facility that has been hacked and spawned a
  [Lattice Logic Unit](Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) and the
  [LLU's](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) destination will now be highlighted on the
  continental map.
- Fixed an exploit that allowed players to deconstruct with the
  [LLU](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) in their [inventory](../terminology/Inventory.md).
- [Respawning](Respawn.md) at a
  [facility](Facility.md) will no longer drain
  [NTU's](NTU.md) from the facility's silo.
