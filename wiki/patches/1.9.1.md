Version 1.9.1 (Aug. 27, 2003)

There will be a patch to the live servers at 3 AM Pacific on August 27, 2003. It
will contain the following items:

- Drivers will gain control of vehicles coming off the creation pad sooner.
- Air vehicles will move off of the vehicle creation pad quicker.
- Vehicles will no longer drift when the driver hits Alt-R. \*The gunner camera
  on the [Vanguard](../vehicles/Vanguard.md) and the
  [Prowler](../vehicles/Prowler.md) will now shake much less.
- [Spitfire](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#spitfire-turret) Turrets
  will now fire in the correct direction to hit their target.
- The link between a facility that has been hacked and spawned a
  [Lattice Logic Unit](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) and the
  [LLU's](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) destination will now be
  highlighted on the continental map.
- Fixed an exploit that allowed players to deconstruct with the
  [LLU](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) in their
  [inventory](../terminology/Inventory.md).
- [Respawning](../terminology/Respawn.md) at a
  [facility](../locations/Facilities.md) will no longer drain
  [NTU's](../items/NTU.md) from the facility's silo.
