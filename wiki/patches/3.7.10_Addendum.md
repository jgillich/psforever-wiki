Version 3.7.10 Addendum (July 18, 2005)

- Changed the [AMS Support](../AMS_Support.md) and [Lodestar
  Support](../Lodestar_Support.md)
  [Merits](../Merit_Commendations.md) to only use Respawn
  [Assists](../Assist.md) and Repair Assists respectively to
  remove a numeration issue that was causing progression on these
  awards to not function as expected. These changes do not alter any
  of the numbers of assist kills or any of your statisitics. It only
  changed the "filter" that looks at your stats and decides wether or
  not to award the merit to you.
