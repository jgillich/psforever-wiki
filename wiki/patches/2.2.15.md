Version [2.2.15](2.2.15.md) (November 25, 2003)

- Resolved some server crash issues.
- [Animation Culling](Animation_Culling.md) is less aggressive. This should
  cause animations to move smoother, even in heavy combat situations.
- Tweaked [backpack](../terminology/Backpack.md) cleanup code so they will not
  cleanup as fast in heavy combat.
