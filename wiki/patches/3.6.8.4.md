Version 3.6.8.4, released May 27, 2005.

## Gameplay Fixes

- Adjusted text strings to refer to the HSR as the "[Heavy Scout
  Rifle](../Heavy_Scout_Rifle.md)"
- Modified [HSR](../Heavy_Scout_Rifle.md) [Cone of
  Fire](../Cone_of_fire.md) properties to have it better fit its
  intended multi-role capabilities as a good medium to long range
  weapon, with better in close range performance over the [Bolt
  Driver](../Bolt_Driver.md).
- Adjusted [wall turrets](../Phalanx.md) to have a less damaging
  explosion.
- Adjusted aircraft ascent and descent performance as follows:
  - [Mosquito](../Mosquito.md): near instant response to
    reflect its nimble design.
  - [Reaver](../Reaver.md): close to the
    [Mosquito](../Mosquito.md), but slightly less responsive,
    due to its heavier frame.
  - [Liberator](../Liberator.md),
    [Lodestar](../Lodestar.md) and [Galaxy](../Galaxy.md):
    slower responses to control, but they have slightly better
    overall thrust for a bit faster ascent and descent
