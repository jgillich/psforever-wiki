Version 3.9.9 (November 18 2005)

**Update Highlights**

- Added sorting to the Training Mission list so that startable
  missions sort to the top.
- The "Reveal Friendlies" and "Reveal Enemies"
  [Uplink](../Command_Uplink_Device.md) functions now display
  [Vehicle](../Vehicle.md) Icons.

**AMS Changes:**

- Fixed a bug that caused players to get stuck inside deployed
  [AMSes](../AMS.md) when parked next to walls or trees.
- Fixed a bug that would occasionally keep deployed AMSes from being
  undeployed.

**MAX Changes:**

- Fixed a bug that allowed [TR](../TR.md)
  [MAXes](../Mechanized_Armored_Exo-Suit.md) to pass through
  walls by combining [Autorun](../Autorun.md) and
  [Anchoring](../Anchoring.md).
- Fixed a bug where MAX Armors could get stuck with full Autorun speed
  by hitting Esc at the Broadcast [Warpgate](../Warpgate.md)
  selection screen.
- Fixed a bug that caused MAX purchase timers to be started when MAX
  Armor was purchased as part of a favorite in the [Virtual
  Training](VR_training.md) [zones](zone.md).

**Miscellaneous Changes:**

- Fixed a bug with the Mission Status window where some times the text
  would not fade all of the way in.
