Version 3.9.9 (November 18 2005)

**Update Highlights**

- Added sorting to the Training Mission list so that startable missions sort to
  the top.
- The "Reveal Friendlies" and "Reveal Enemies"
  [Uplink](../weapons/Command_Uplink_Device.md) functions now display
  [Vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) Icons.

**AMS Changes:**

- Fixed a bug that caused players to get stuck inside deployed
  [AMSes](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) when parked next to walls or
  trees.
- Fixed a bug that would occasionally keep deployed AMSes from being undeployed.

**MAX Changes:**

- Fixed a bug that allowed [TR](../etc/Terran_Republic.md)
  [MAXes](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) to pass through walls by
  combining [Autorun](../terminology/Autorun.md) and
  [Anchoring](../terminology/Anchoring.md).
- Fixed a bug where MAX Armors could get stuck with full Autorun speed by
  hitting Esc at the Broadcast [Warpgate](../locations/Warpgate.md) selection
  screen.
- Fixed a bug that caused MAX purchase timers to be started when MAX Armor was
  purchased as part of a favorite in the
  [Virtual Training](../locations/VR_Training.md)
  [zones](../terminology/Zone.md).

**Miscellaneous Changes:**

- Fixed a bug with the Mission Status window where some times the text would not
  fade all of the way in.
- Dropped [Striker](../weapons/Striker.md) Ammo should now be visible.
