# 2.7.8

Version 2.7.8 (June 11, 2004)

- The [Thunderer](../vehicles/Thunderer.md)'s
  [Gauss Cannon](../items/Gauss_Cannon.md) projectile now has a 1.5m radius
  explosion, rather than a 3.0m radius explosion.
- The [Aurora](../vehicles/Aurora.md)'s Fluxpod clip has been increased from 6
  shots to 12 shots. Secondary fire salvo size is still 6 shots. Damage to
  [infantry](../terminology/Infantry.md) and [armor](../armor/index.md)
  will be slightly lowered, though damage to infantry over 10 seconds is now
  increased, due to the increased clip size. Its damage against aircraft has
  been substantially increased.
- The Enemy Density Warning has had its labels changed to Yellow (lowest density
  alert) Orange (medium density alert), and Red (highest density alert).
- Cleaned up various text strings.
