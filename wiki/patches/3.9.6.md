Version 3.9.6, released October 13, 2005.

### Combat Engineer Window

- Added a Combat Engineer window for viewing deployables.
- You can toggle the C.E. window by pressing Alt-E by default
  (remappable in the global keymap list of the Options page).
- This window shows how many [Mines](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Mine),
  [Boomers](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Boomer), [Motion
  Sensors](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Motion_Sensor), and [Spitfire
  Turrets](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Spitfire_Turret) the player has deployed,
  along with the deploy limits.

**[Rabbit](../terminology/Rabbit.md) Changes**

- Added Rabbit sound preferences on the Sound Options page to allow
  players to disable the Rabbit ball drop, pickup, and reset sounds.

<!-- -->

- Changed it so Rabbit ball carriers that are in
  [vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) that are destroyed by friendly fire
  are bailed unharmed from the vehicles instead of killed in the
  explosions.

<!-- -->

- Made the Rabbit status window a bit transparent
