Valentine's Day Patch

- Been through some bad relationships? Visit
  [VR Training](../locations/VR_Training.md) and get back at all the lovers that
  have jilted you in the past!
- Anyone that logs in between now and Valentine's Day will be awarded with the
  [Ball & Chain](Ball_.md&_Chain) [merit](../merits/Merit_Commendations.md)!
- Several events will be run, including more
  [Black Ops](../terminology/Black_Ops.md) and a "Surgile" event!
- Pain field damage in the caverns' spawn rooms has been increased slightly to
  that of a [Pain Module](../etc/Pain_Module.md).
