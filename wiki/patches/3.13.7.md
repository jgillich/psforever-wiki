- Players should now be able to deconstruct Deployables that overlap the

  when they attempt to [recall](../terminology/Recall.md).
- [Wall Turrets](../items/Phalanx.md) should no longer have a problem hitting a
  deployed [Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md).

- Players with the “bare head” appearance option checked should now remain
  hat-less until the option is changed.
- An issue with the double armor bars for [vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) has
  been corrected.
- Vehicle weapons can now switch fire modes immediately after firing with no
  ammo.
- The weapons module should no longer charge weapons to a quantity above the
  maximum clip size.
- Slider bars in the various settings menus should now stay at the maximum
  position when dragged there.
- [Amp Station](../locations/Amp_Station.md)
  [Pain Fields](../terminology/Pain_Field.md) should no longer hurt you when
  standing next to the downstairs lockers. In addition, AMP station pain fields
  will no longer deal damage through closed doors.
- The [Squad](../terminology/Squad.md) bar should no longer overlap the
  [HUD](../terminology/Heads-up_Display.md) bar.
