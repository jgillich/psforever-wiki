- If a [Cavern](../Cavern.md) is locked, then any friendly surface
  [Facilities](Facilities.md) connected to that cavern (via the
  [Lattice](Lattice.md) through the [Geowarps](Geowarp.md)) will act as if it
  had all six modules installed.
- Hand-held [Ancient Technology](Ancient_Technology.md) weapons now have
  "recharge capacitor units" (Ancient Tech "ammo") that you can buy at

  [facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) with the
  [Equipment Module](Equipment_Module.md) benefit.

  consumed before.
