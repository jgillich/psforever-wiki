# 3.11

This version (released March 16, 2006) introduces a large number of UI and help
system improvements, primarily in preparation of an influx of new players from
the [PlanetSide Reserves](../terminology/PlanetSide_Reserves.md) program.

## Update Highlights

### Features

- Players can create characters from all three
  [empires](../terminology/Empire.md) now.
- Added an optional free [certification](../certifications/Certification.md)
  reset that will be granted upon logging into the 3.11 build for the first
  time. There is an option to Forget All certifications when you open up a
  [certification terminal](../items/Certification_Terminal.md).
- Increased the capacity of the [Burster](../armor/Burster.md) ammo box from 50
  to 100
- Increased the velocity of the [Burster](../armor/Burster.md) projectile (There
  was some talks that the Burster was having difficulty reaching the ceiling or
  that the projectiles were being forgotten by the client. We verified that this
  scenario was false and the point of contention was the speed of the
  projectile. It took quite some time to hit the ceiling in it's current state
  therefore the speed was increased to compensate for this downfall)
- Decreased the refire time of the [Burster](../armor/Burster.md) while unlocked
- Increased the initial velocity of the [Sparrow](../armor/Sparrow.md)
  projectile
- Reduced the lifespan of the [Sparrow](../armor/Sparrow.md) projectile to keep
  their range the same (because the velocity change increased their range which
  was not needed as it can already reach the ceiling)
- Created new [certification](../certifications/Certification.md) for the
  [Switchblade](../items/Switchblade.md)
- Changed the Switchblade certification prerequisite to
  [ATV](../vehicles/ATV.md)
- Switchblade armor was reduced
- Increased the Switchblade's purchase timer to 5 minutes
- The first time help icon has been replaced with a glowing exclamation point to
  coincide with the recent art changes.
- Added [BR24+](../terminology/Battle_Rank.md) hats and berets. Characters of
  all three [empires](../terminology/Empire.md) gain the option to wear a hat or
  beret when they reach Battle Rank 24. The /hat command is used to put the hats
  on and take them off (the /helmet command must first be used to hide the
  helmet).
- Added the Appearance dialog, accessible by clicking the Customize Appearance
  button on the Character pane. This dialog allows players to quickly choose
  which optional items they want their character to display.
- Knife holster has been added to both the status bar and the inventory page.
- Confirmation dialogs have been added for the /outfitkick and /outfitleave
  [chat commands](../chat/In-Game_Commands.md).
- Made it so it is possible to skip through the Bending and
  [BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) movies by hitting any key.
- Added more signs to make Training in [sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md)
  more noticeable
- Added a timed helper that assists new players by popping up context-specific
  help as they move around in the game.

## UI polish and new player modifications

- Edited first-time help texts for brevity
- Changed screenshot to PrintScreen
- Fixed a bug that allowed [TR](../factions/Terran_Republic.md)
  [MAXes](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) to unload full clips by
  reloading right after anchoring
- Made it so jumping cancels all recalls and rematrixes.
- Fixed a minor bug where destroyed [Router](../vehicles/Router.md) teleport
  pads would still emit sound.
- Polished cursor graphics so they stand out better
- Increased the font size of the session stats window
- Scrollbar in [empire](../terminology/Empire.md) description on the character
  creation screen now shows only if needed
- Improved the W graphic on the proximity radar window
- [Platoon](../terminology/Platoon.md) default chat color is now bright orange
  which should be much easier to read
- Tweaked the third person camera speed to compensate for mouse wheel and
  keyboard use
- Increased default mouse sensitivity
- Increased default opacity of windows to increase legibility. This will only
  affect new players.
- Due to player feedback we added "Invert Map Mouse look Zoom" as a toggle game
  option
- Removed some un-needed space from the Performance Window
- Continent map now uses a more "RTS Style" mouse scrolling where placing the
  mouse at the edge of the screen will scroll and won't get blocked by windows
  or the top toolbar.
- Changed the new character default
  [certifications](../certifications/Certification.md) to have
  [ATV](../vehicles/ATV.md) and [Harasser](../vehicles/Harasser.md) instead of
  [Armored Assault I](../certifications/Armored_Assault_I.md). This was to avoid
  the confusing "Invalid Armor" situation for new players until they are more
  familiar with the game.
- Improved the first-time help when opening the map in warpgate selection mode
- Improved the first-time help when opening a map in normal viewing mode
- Slight increase in default size of the radar window to better align with other
  windows
- Added pop up helps for using [weapons](../weapons/Weapon.md) and medkits the
  first time you enter a battle zone
- Corrected an issue where you could select a row on the CE window leaving a
  yellow highlight that would last until you logged
- Changed the
  [Boomer](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#remote-detonated-charge-boomer)
  icon to be easier to tell from the
  [HE Mine](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#high-explosive-mine) icon
- Added tooltips to icons on the CE Window
- Changed order of icons in the CE Window to mirror
  [ACE](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md) fire mode selection order
- Revised the [Certification](../certifications/Certification.md) training
  mission text so it refers to the correct 6 hour unlearn timer rather than the
  old 24 hour timer
- Made it so reserve ammo does not display for
  [Switchblades](../items/Switchblade.md), [Flails](../vehicles/Flail.md), and
  Cavern Turrets. Since you can never reload these weapons anyway there is no
  point to display 0 for the reload reserve.
- Corrected an issue where [vehicle](../vehicles/index.md) timer text could
  overlap with the vehicle name on the
  [Vehicle Terminal](../locations/Vehicle_Terminal.md) selection window
- Changed the font used on ammo boxes in the inventory window
- Modified position of holster numbers in inventory window
- Fixed bug where the driver of some [vehicles](../vehicles/index.md) would
  not start in first person camera view from the vehicle pad
- Fixed text strings that were referring to old window names (ex. Soldier
  Management is now Game Windows)
- Decreased default time that first-time help windows stay up to 60 seconds
  (reduced from 120)
- [Mosquito](../vehicles/Mosquito.md) radar icon should not disappear after
  traveling through a [warpgate](../locations/Warpgate.md).
- Removed tooltips from the Create Character screen face grid and the Select
  Outfit Decal dialog.
- All flak projectiles ([Burster](../armor/Burster.md),
  [BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) Burster,
  [Skyguard](../vehicles/Skyguard.md), and
  [Flaklet](../weapons/Rocklet_Rifle.md)) now detonate upon impacting flight
  vehicles and flying BFRs.
- Added Session Stats, Performance, and Combat Engineering to Game Windows
  window
- Added window name and hotkey next to buttons on Game Windows window
- Changed some window titles
- [Outfit](../terminology/Outfit.md) Info → Outfit
- [Vehicle](../vehicles/index.md) Access → Vehicle
- Soldier Management → Game Windows
- Organizational Info → Players (which is more intuitive for the P key mapping)
- Default key mapping changes
  - Outfit is now O
  - Character is now U, instead of O. While neither is intuitive, at least U is
    EQ2 standard, and allows O to be Outfit, which is intuitive.
- Made session stats window default to not showing for new players
- Changed session and performance stat windows to save their visibility state in
  same way other windows do.
- Removed "show session stats" option from Options:Game; players will just use
  the key mapping
- Tweaked appearance of Performance Stats to look like other stats
- Improved layout of front end screens by grouping buttons by importance, and
  increasing contrast between back/next and secondary buttons
- Eliminated unnecessary/erroneous tooltips from front end
- Replaced X button with more explicit EXIT button
- Eliminated confirmation dialog when exiting the game
- In server list, fixed column heading from SERVER LIST to SERVER
- Changed character creation step 2 so BACK button goes back to empire
  selection, not character selection
- Slightly tinted planet backdrop in front-end with complementary color to set
  off foreground controls more

  English
- Added zone name to loading screen
- Polished loading screen presentation
- Removed unnecessary Name header text from Favorites tab on Equipment terminal
- Changed NEXT button on character creation to read FINISH
- Removed "Are you sure you want to disconnect?" confirmation when Back button
  is pressed on character select screen
- Changed first-use-help window appearance to contrast more with normal windows,
  and be easier to read. It also auto sizes its height to the text (up to a
  point), and only shows the scrollbar if needed.
- Reversed mouse wheel zoom direction on map; it was previously the opposite of
  the standard, which is irritating for new players
- Numerous small tweaks to the popup texts for clarity (ex. changing "Press the
  G key to purchase from the terminal" to "Press G to use the equipment
  terminal"), aesthetics, and brevity.
- Changed server names from Markov (and Johari) and Emerald (and Konried) to
  just [Markov](../archive/servers/Markov.md) and [Emerald](../archive/servers/Emerald.md).
- Disabled first-time help for [sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) (obsolete
  now)
- Tweaked alignment of many windows for polish and consistency
- Performance stats window and soldier management pane are hidden by default now
- Commented out behavior of auto-showing performance stats window in response to
  link dead warning
- Increased default height of vehicle, equipment, and BFR windows, so players
  can see a bit more without scrolling.
- Fixed bug where windows would try to avoid overlapping vehicle damage display;
  this would cause bad-looking default alignments
- Fixed alignment of re-spawning dialog; it would move to a bad spot when you
  increase resolution higher than 1024×768
- Made Invert Flying Input the default, so up = up and down = down, which is a
  lot more intuitive for new players
- Hooked in timed help triggers for the following events:
  - First [Infiltration Suit](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md)
  - First [MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) suit (different help
    for each empires)
  - First equip weapon with multiple fire modes
  - First equip weapon with multiple ammo types
  - First acquire of vehicles with special actions
    ([AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md),
    [ANT](../vehicles/Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md),
    [Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md), [Router](../vehicles/Router.md),
    [Switchblade](../items/Switchblade.md))
  - Driving instructions on first acquire of a ground vehicle
  - Piloting instructions on first acquire of a
    [BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md)
  - Flying instructions on first acquire of an air vehicle
  - First passenger Instructions on how to bail aircraft and ground vehicles
- Removed the "You have left the world" confirmation dialog except in cases of
  link death
- Fixed very minor visual bug on macro bar (pixel overlaps on separator bars)
- Gave infiltrator visibility gauge a little bit of padding on either side; it
  was previously too close together in with H/S/A.
- Made camera in/out work as zoom in/out while in first person
- Removed Chat and Radar toggles from Soldier Management. Leaving the key
  mappings in, in case anyone logs out with them hidden being able to re-show
  them.
- Removed Soldier Management behavior of auto-aligning itself with top or bottom
  of screen.
- Changed default location of container and rearm windows so that the two
  windows will not overlap by default.
- Vehicle pane will come up centered now by default
- Changed Toggle UI to just F10 by default
- Windows
  - Moved most window toggles into HUD (all except chat window)
  - Unmapped toggles for Chat, Radar, and Star Help by default
  - Unmapped toggle for Solider Management in expectation of it being changed
  - Changed Vehicle to Alt+V
  - Changed Outfit to Alt+O
  - Changed Stats window to Alt+S (so you don't constantly toggle it on/off
    while crouching)
  - Changed Performance window to Alt+P
- Changed BFR strafe from Alt+Q/E to Shift+Q/E to avoid clashes with window
  mappings
- Changed order of key mappings in list to better group related functions
- Unmapped toggles related to squad waypoints and experience
- Removed nVidia and redundant [PlanetSide](../PlanetSide.md) Logo splash
  screens
- Made login screen look more like server select screen, to reduce visual pop in
  transition
- Removed Help button from all front-end screens, just not necessary anymore
- Tweaked appearance and default location of Friends monitor
- Changed exclamation help window to allow overlap
- Changed default locations of performance window and indicators (crouching,
  etc)
- Vehicle direction indicator no longer auto-opened, though players can still
  toggle it.
- Fixed bug where UI is briefly visible at start of drop pod sequence
- Game Windows window closes on Esc, or when button pressed. The idea is to make
  it a window that you use only when you can't remember the hotkeys.
- Added "Invert Map Mouse look Zoom" Game Option, for players who are used to
  the old direction

## Missions

- Training Missions have been further revised
- Revised all of the training missions to flash the Next button in any mission
  step that requires pressing the button to advance and does not explicitly
  instruct the player to press the button. The button will start flashing after
  a short delay. The length of the delay will correspond to how much text is
  displayed in the mission window.
- Adjusted mission window appearance
- Added a "Show Mission List" button to the Mission Status window. This button
  appears after completing a step in a mission to provide an easy way to call
  the mission list back up.
- Mission window auto-changes between full and minimized views based on whether
  there are currently any objectives
- Removed "Cancel Mission" button on Mission window. Pressing X now cancels the
  mission
- Changed color of "Mission Cancelled" text to red
- Scrollbars on mission window only show when needed
- Corrected an issue where missions stop or gate randomly preventing completion.
  Now you should be able to complete all the missions on the 1st try!
- Missions should indicate the key that you currently have configured for the
  specified action, rather than instructing you to use the default keys
- Changed wording of option to "Show First Time Help" instead of "Show Star-Help
  Training"
- Revised the Map and [MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) and
  [Infiltration Suit](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md) training missions.
- Found the bug that was causing training mission steps to occasionally fail to
  advance.
- Fixed a missing string token in the Implants training mission.
- Fixed bug where equipment terminal and inventory window would appear in a
  non-user-friendly position during Basic Training mission with default UI
  settings
- Removed the [HUD](../terminology/Heads-up_Display.md) training mission

## Map and Radar

- Tactical overlay settings are now saved correctly between sessions
- Removed the default key mapping for the Tactical Overlay as it was too easy
  for new players to accidentally turn it on or off and not know they did.
- Unmapped most display toggles by default (all but Tactical); as a new player
  it was very easy to accidentally toggle something off (like hitting Q and
  suddenly you can't see yourself) and not know how to recover or even worse,
  not even know it is turned off. (Where are you guys? I can't see the squad!)
- Removed buttons and title bar from radar window
- Added text display of current range to top right corner of radar. Needed when
  auto-zooming in and out
- [Continent](../locations/Continent.md) map now re-centers and zooms out when
  map switches to [warpgate](../locations/Warpgate.md) destination or drop
  location selection, so you don't need to pan or zoom to select.

## Looking For (LFS)

- Removed LFS toggle from chat window (moved to status bar)
- Due to player feedback the find squad pane is no longer launched by toggling
  on LFS
- Added "Toggle LFS" Keymap (ALT-L by default)
- Added key maps to tooltips on LFS and Game Window buttons
- Corrected an issue with the "Auto LFS On" game option where you would be
  placed LFS even if this option was toggled OFF
