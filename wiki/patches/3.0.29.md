Live Version 3.0.29 (November 5, 2004)

- The basic [BFR](../BFR.md)
  [certification](Certification.md) will now only give access
  to the AV weapon systems along with the [NTU](../NTU.md) siphon
  and armor siphon weapons.
- Added BFR [Anti-Infantry](../Anti-Infantry.md) and BFR
  Anti-Aircraft certifications at 1 cert point cost. These must be
  taken in order for a BFR pilot to outfit their BFR with these other
  weapon systems. There is no dependence on the BFR Gunner weapons;
  the BFR pilot can buy whatever gunner weapons he wants to outfit his
  battleframe with. This was to keep the gunner from having to
  actually have the certification to use the gun.
- In light of the certification changes for BattleFrame Robotics, we
  have reset all character certifications to allow everyone to reset
  their character build as they desire.
- Slight reduction of BFR weapon systems against secondary and
  tertiary targets. For example, the default AV loadouts did not
  change in their performance against vehicle targets, but are
  slightly less effective against infantry, aircraft and MAXs.
- Moderately reduced BFR shield regeneration rate, but increased the
  overall amount of absorption the shield will take before being beat
  to zero.
- Slightly reduced BFR chassis armor absorption of damage from small
  arms fire, making small arms, especially AP ammo, more effective.
