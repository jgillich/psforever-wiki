Version 3.6.8, released May 17, 2005.

## Features

On May 19, 2005, PlanetSide celebrates its 2nd Year Anniversary. This
anniversary brings two special rewards for the community. A Two Year Term of
Service Merit and a Heavy Sniper Rifle.

- [Two Year Term of Service Merit](../merits/Term_of_Service.md) - This merit is
  granted to characters that have been in creation for two years.
- [Heavy Sniper Rifle](../weapons/Heavy_Scout_Rifle.md) - The Heavy Sniper Rifle
  is a powerful alternative to the Bolt Driver for snipers. It uses high-caliber
  "bolt" ammunition like the Bolt Driver, but holds a ten-shot clip and can be
  fired much more rapidly, albeit with a significant penalty to accuracy. All
  three empires have chosen to make this weapon available to all soldiers with
  at least two years of service.
