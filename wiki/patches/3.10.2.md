Released Thursday, December 22, 2005.

Introduces a number of adjustments to
[BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md).

- Added BFR shield strength indicator for players with the
  [Enhanced Targeting](../implants/Enhanced_Targeting.md)
  [Implant](../implants/Implants.md)
- Flight Variant BFR shield deactivates when the BFR starts flying and remains
  inactive until a few seconds after the BFR lands
- Flight Variant BFR shield drains while the BFR remains flying
- All weaponry that can lock onto flight vehicles can now also lock onto Flight
  Variant BFRs while they are flying
- [Flak](../weapons/Flak.md) projectiles (like the ones fired by the TR
  [Burster](../items/Burster.md) MAX and the [Skyguard](../vehicles/Skyguard.md))
  now detonate on proximity to flying Flight Variant BFRs as they do with other
  flying vehicles
