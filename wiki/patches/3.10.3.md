## Update Highlights

- NVIDIA CG DLLs have been updated from 1.0 to 1.4.
- Holiday features have been removed (hats, gift boxes, tree lights, and the
  /humbug command)
- Fixed a bug where the Lasers on the [Aphelion](../vehicles/Aphelion.md) and
  [Eclipse](../vehicles/Eclipse.md) would not always do damage when fired
  directly upon a stationary target.
