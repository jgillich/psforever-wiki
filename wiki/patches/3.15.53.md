## Official Patch Notes

After finding they couldn't meet with the demands on improved armor for
all of those tanks, Nano manufacturing settings switched the improved
armor from Main Battle Tanks to smaller vehicles, starting with small
air vehicles (Mosquito, Wasp and Reaver). To help infantry survive the
influx of air Nano in the wild the remaining reserves of the improved
armor materials were diverted to the Deliverers, Raiders, Thunderers,
Auroras and all buggies and ATVs. The improved armor supplies will be
depleted soon so make sure you get as much out of them as you can before
we have to resort to older materials for all vehicles.

Additionally, a peace accord was arranged regarding using improved armor
material on knives and knives will no longer be manufactured with such
material and return to normal.

In other advancements, to help keep up with the constantly changing
battlefield, cloning scientists have come up with a way to reset solider
training, a recertification, and will be issuing these to all soldiers
with the armor change and again when the improved armor material has run
out.

Other Notes: The clip size of the lasher has been lowered to 35 orbs per
clip.
