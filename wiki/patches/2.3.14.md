Version [2.3.14](2.3.14.md) (December 14, 2003)

- Fixed a [Zone](../terminology/Zone.md) crash that occurred as a result of
  healing a person and switching targets.
- Fixed a Client crash that occurred after dying while tracking an object (using
  a [Striker](../weapons/Striker.md), for example).
