Version 3.12.31 (Thursday August 23, 2007)

- [Phantasm](../vehicles/Phantasm.md)
  - Removed the gun so the Phantasm will be used less for farming infantry and
    more for transport.
  - Reduced explosion damage on destruction.

<!-- -->

- [Galaxy Gunship](../vehicles/Galaxy_Gunship.md)
  - Greatly increased armor while only slightly increasing repair time.
  - 35mm bullet speed and damage have been increased.
  - [Ground Pounder](../terminology/Ground_Pounder.md) damage has been
    increased.
  - Angle of fire has been increased for front and wing guns.
  - Increased [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) size.
  - Purchase timer has been increased to 10 minutes.

<!-- -->

- [Combat Engineers](../certifications/Combat_Engineering.md)
  - There has been a recent breakthrough in engineering technology for players
    who are trained in
    [Advanced Engineering](../certifications/Advanced_Engineering.md) concepts!
    Combat Engineers now use [Armor Canisters](../items/Armor_Canister.md) more
    efficiently and will be able to repair
    [MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) units, equipment, and
    [vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) faster than players with the standard
    Engineering [certification](../certifications/Certification.md). Repair
    speed is further increased for players with
    [Fortification](../certifications/Fortification_Engineering.md),
    [Assault](../certifications/Assault_Engineering.md), or Advanced
    Engineering. Infantry armor other than MAX armor will not be affected by
    this change.
