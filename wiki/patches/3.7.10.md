**NOTOC** Version 3.7.10 (July 14, 2005)

### New Additions

- The [Support Merit
  Commendations](../Support_Merit_Commendations.md) have been
  updated. You can view the [updated requirement information to get
  further
  details](http://psforums.station.sony.com/ps/board/message?board.id=indevelopment&message.id=7586).

<!-- -->

- The Support Merit Commendations graphics have been arranged based on
  type of roles. Below is the convention used:

<!-- -->

  - - The sidebars are green to indicate a support merit and the
    second inner stripes indicate the rank.

<!-- -->

  - - Primary stripe colors:
    - Red = Healing and reviving
    - Blue = Repairing armor or equipment
    - Orange = related to support vehicles
    - Green = related to hacking

<!-- -->

  - - Background colors:
    - White, Grey = related to healing or repairing infantry
      (white designated for reviving type merits)
    - Black = vehicle related
    - Orange = robotics related
    - Blue = related to air vehicles
    - Dark Green = hacking related

<!-- -->

- The only support merits that don't follow the above are the [Router
  Support](../Router_Support.md) and [Telepad
  Deployment](../Telepad_Deployment.md) awards. Those have a
  black background and purple and light purple stripes for the
  [Router](../Router.md) and [Telepad](../Telepad.md),
  respectively.

<!-- -->

- Also, the Healing, Reviving, and Repairing merits were arranged so
  that they can form a "+" symbol, and the Hacking awards were
  arranged so that they can form an "H".

<!-- -->

- The [Support Experience System and Support Merits
  FAQ](http://psforums.station.sony.com/ps/board/message?board.id=faq&message.id=28)
  on the forums has been updated.
