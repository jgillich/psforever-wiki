The **Main terminal** of each [Facility](Facility.md) is located
in the [main lobby](main_lobby.md).

For Squad/Platoon Leaders the Main terminal can be used to:

- [Recall](Recall.md) your [Squad](Squad.md) to
  [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md) (Must be [Squad
  Leader](Squad_Leader.md))
- Recall your [Platoon](Platoon.md) to Sanctuary (Must be
  [Platoon Leader](Platoon_Leader.md))
- Set Squad's [Home Base](Squad_Home_Base.md) (Must be Squad
  Leader)
- Set Platoon's Home Base (Must be Platoon Leader)
- Recall Squad to Home Base (Must be Squad Leader)

Players certed in the [Data Corruption](Data_Corruption.md)
[certification](certification.md) can hack into the Main
Terminal of an enemy facility and upload [viruses](virus.md)
that will infect the facility, causing a variety of effects depending on
the virus.

[Expert Hackers](Expert_Hacking.md) can access the Main Terminal
at friendly infected facilities to remove a virus, which will return the
facility back to normal.

The Main terminal can be hacked and used by a friendly [Advanced
Hacker](Advanced_Hacking.md) when the [base](base.md) is
hacked by the enemy, provided there is at least one [Spawn
Tube](Spawn_Tube.md) active and the
[Generator](Generator.md) is online.

The Main Terminal can not be destroyed.
