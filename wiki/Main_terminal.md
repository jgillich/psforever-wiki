For Squad/Platoon Leaders the Main terminal can be used to:

- [Recall](Recall.md "wikilink") your [Squad](Squad.md "wikilink") to
  [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink") (Must be [Squad
  Leader](Squad_Leader.md "wikilink"))
- Recall your [Platoon](Platoon.md "wikilink") to Sanctuary (Must be

Players certed in the [Data Corruption](Data_Corruption.md "wikilink")
[certification](certification.md "wikilink") can hack into the Main
Terminal of an enemy facility and upload [viruses](virus.md "wikilink")
that will infect the facility, causing a variety of effects depending on
the virus.

[Expert Hackers](Expert_Hacking.md "wikilink") can access the Main Terminal
at friendly infected facilities to remove a virus, which will return the
facility back to normal.

The Main terminal can be hacked and used by a friendly [Advanced
Hacker](Advanced_Hacking.md "wikilink") when the [base](base.md "wikilink") is
hacked by the enemy, provided there is at least one [Spawn
Tube](Spawn_Tube.md "wikilink") active and the
[Generator](Generator.md "wikilink") is online.

The Main Terminal can not be destroyed.
