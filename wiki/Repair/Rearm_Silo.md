The **Repair/Rearm Silo** is a large cylindrical structure attached to
two walls in each continent's [surface
bases](Facilities.md#Surface_Bases "wikilink"), and to the [HART
buildings](HART_building.md "wikilink") in each
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink"). They can be used to rearm ground
[vehicles](vehicle.md "wikilink") and [BFRs](BFR.md "wikilink"), as long as
the base is powered and in friendly hands. Also, when the facility is
linked to a friendly [Dropship Center](Dropship_Center.md "wikilink") or
your empire has the [Oshur](Oshur.md "wikilink") [Continental
lock](Continental_lock.md "wikilink"), they will automatically repair most
friendly vehicles and BFRs that approach them. [Flail](Flail.md "wikilink")
and [Switchblades](Switchblade.md "wikilink") require the [Vehicle
Module](Vehicle_Module.md "wikilink") benefit to repair and recharge at
these terminals.

Also sometimes referred to as a _Ground Repair/Rearm Station_ or _Repair
Terminal_.
