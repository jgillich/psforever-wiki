The **Repair/Rearm Silo** is a large cylindrical structure attached to
two walls in each continent's [surface
bases](/Facilities#Surface_Bases "wikilink"), and to the [HART
buildings](/HART_building "wikilink") in each
[Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink"). They can be used to rearm ground
[vehicles](/vehicle "wikilink") and [BFRs](/BFR "wikilink"), as long as
the base is powered and in friendly hands. Also, when the facility is
linked to a friendly [Dropship Center](/Dropship_Center "wikilink") or
your empire has the [Oshur](/Oshur "wikilink") [Continental
lock](/Continental_lock "wikilink"), they will automatically repair most
friendly vehicles and BFRs that approach them. [Flail](/Flail "wikilink")
and [Switchblades](/Switchblade "wikilink") require the [Vehicle
Module](/Vehicle_Module "wikilink") benefit to repair and recharge at
these terminals.

Also sometimes referred to as a _Ground Repair/Rearm Station_ or _Repair
Terminal_.
