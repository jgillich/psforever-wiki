## Disambiguation Pages

A disambiguation page is one that links different topics of the same
name together so that the viewer of the page can select which use of the
term the user wishes to view. These pages serve the purpose of
conforming with the purpose of a wiki to keep links simple and easy to
navigate. However, when multiple subjects share a common name, such as
[Map](/Map "wikilink"), a user can become confused by this mixture of
unrelated topics.

## Disambiguous Links

Disambiguous links are links that point to disambguation pages. These
links were originally intended to point to an article of one meaning or
another, but due to the creation of a disambuation page, these links are
no longer valid redirections to their intended destination. These links
should be modified so that the destination article is restored as the
result of clicking the link.

## Maintenance

To keep track of disambiguation pages, the {{disambig}} tag is added at
the bottom of the page to inform users about the disambiguity.

To keep track of and eliminate disamgibuous links, click the "What links
here" link in the toolbox. The links to the disambiguation page should
be changed as described above.
