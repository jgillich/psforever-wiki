-M7- is a new [Outfit](/Outfit "wikilink") formed out of the long running
alliance between **The Militia** (founded first in beta, then in May at
retail)and **7th Corps** (founded in the summer of '03). After a long
time of playing together, using the same TS server and website we
decided to abandon our old outfits and play under our unified moniker.
This was done to end confusion and make things easier for us to
coordinate work together. We are led by Delta25, the long running OL
from the Militia, and a solid core of officers.

We are an all fun outfit first and foremost. We have a variety of
playstyles depending on what our mood is for the day. We played
important rolls in [NC](/NC "wikilink") [Markov](/Markov "wikilink")'s
victories in the first two Monolith events and look forward to helping
the Empire succeed in future events.

We have expanded into other games as well. You can see the \[M7\] tag
running around in BFV and CS:S and we have a WoW guild: the Seventh
Militia.

We are always looking for new recruits of all playstyles, new players
and veterans alike. Come visit us at:
