The most basic element of strategy in Planeteside is the fine art of
capturing [bases](Facilities.md). Though the mechanics of a base
capture are simple, there's a lot of different ways you can do it.

<h3>

The Goal: Hack the CC

</h3>

When you are attacking a base the ultimate goal will be to
[hack](Hack.md) the [Control
Console](Control_Console.md) of the facility and secure the
control console. You must keep control of the CC until either the 15
minute capture timer runs, or in the case of an [LLU](Lattice_Logic_Unit.md)
base, the LLU is delivered.

It takes 20 seconds for an [advanced
hacker](Advanced_Hacking.md) to control a CC, so you must be
sure that the CC is never insecure for more than 20 seconds.
Furthermore, when you are attempting to stop an enemy from taking your
base, remember that once it gets down to that 20 second mark, they will
get the base, so it's time to change from defense to offense at that
base.

<h3>

Securing the hack

</h3>

Ultimately, control of a base comes down to controlling [spawn
points](spawn_point.md). If you can [spawn](Spawn.md) at
a base and the enemy cannot, you will win most of the time. It is
possible for well coordinated forces to retake a CC without having a
nearby spawn point but it is far more difficult to do so.

There are three types of spawn points to consider in this situation:

1.  [AMS](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md)
2.  [Towers](Towers.md)
3.  Base [spawn tubes](Respawn_Tube.md)

<h3>

Base Spawn Tubes

</h3>

Generally speaking, the closer a spawn is to the CC, the more dangerous
it is going to be for you. The base spawns, being inside the base, are
obviously the greatest threat to a successful base capture.

To shut down the base spawns you can either destroy the individual tubes
or destroy the [generator](Generator.md). A tube can be
destroyed with one boomer, three decimators, or a number of other
combinations of weapons. Armor piercing and AV weapons are going to be
best suited to destroying tubes.

The tubes, though easily destroyed, are also easily repaired. An
engineer need only repair one tube half way to permit forces to spawn at
the base. So another tactic is to destroy the generator.

A destroyed generator is more difficult to recover from because it not
only shuts down the spawn but also all equipment terminals. It also
takes more effort to repair a damaged generator. The side-effect of
taking down a gen though is that, as the attacker, you also lose the
ability to make use of the equipment terminals at the base.

<b>Destroying generators should usually be avoided except as a last
resort.</b> You should <b><i>never</i></b> destroy the generator of a
base that is your first link into a continent. This will leave you with
no ability to spawn vehicles on the continent.

<h3>

Towers

</h3>

[Towers](Towers.md), though usually a good distance from the
base, are dangerous because of two factors:

1.  MAX units can be obtained at them
2.  Towers are indestructible

<h3>

AMS's

</h3>

Though AMS's can be destroyed, unlike a tower, it requires that somebody
be able to get outdoors with the proper gear to do it. In a heated
battle with many enemies spawning close to the base, this may not be
possible.
