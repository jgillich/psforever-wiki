[Sensor Shield](Sensor_Shield.md), originally known as **Silent
Run**, protects the user from any sort of sensing devices, including:

- [Motion Alarm Sensors](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md)
- [Spitfire Turrets](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md)
- [Shadow Turrets](Shadow_Turret.md)
- [Mosquito](Mosquito.md) radar
- [Interlink Facility](Interlink.md) benefits
- [Audio Amplifier](Audio_Amplifier.md)

[MAX](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) units cannot use Sensor Shield.

Sensor Shield will also prevent damage from the low level [Pain
Fields](Pain_Field.md) that exist in all base spawn rooms. It
does not protect against an installed [Pain
Module](Pain_Module.md) though.

For [infiltrators](</Infiltration_Suit_(Certification)>), the
Sensor Shield will remain on indefinitely inside a pain field as long
you stay in one position. The Sensor Shield will eventually run out of
[Stamina](Stamina.md) for [infantry](Infantry.md).

The Sensor Shield will also eliminate the sound of your footsteps,
making it impossible for an enemy to hear you.

Sensor Shield will not protect you if you take damage. It will also not
protect you if you are within the [SOI](Sphere_of_Influence.md) of a base with
Interlink benefits and you try to use an item
([weapons](:category:Weapons), [REKs](Remote_Electronics_Kit.md), etc.).
