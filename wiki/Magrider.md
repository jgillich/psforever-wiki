**Magrider**

The Magrider is the [Vanu Sovereignty](/Vanu_Sovereignty "wikilink")'s
medium battle tank (MBT). Unique because of its non-tracked drive, the
Magrider floats above the ground, enabling the vehicle to travel over
water and strafe. It can be agile even when traversing rough terrain.
The Magrider is the fastest of all MBTs, with a top speed of 67-68kph.
\[This speed is achived by driving the vehicle at an angle while
strafing and moving forward.\]

The primary weapon of the Magrider is the heavy rail beam. Capable of
direct line-of-sight fire, it is an (almost) pinpoint accurate weapon.
The gun has very little splash damage, and requires multiple hits to
kill a reasonably armored trooper. It is also the weakest gun of the
MBTs, but the long range of the gun means that the Magrider can engage
enemies before they can respond. The Magrider is also the only MBT armed
with a driver weapon, the pulsed particle accelerator. The Magrider may
NOT be driven while wearing the [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](/Reinforced_Exo-Suit "wikilink").

The Magrider requires a [Technology Plant](/Technology_Plant "wikilink")
lattice link or [Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink") vehicle pad in order
to be purchasable.

Shots to kill (with Heavy Rail Beam only):
