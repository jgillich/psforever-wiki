## Character Creation

Welcome to PlanetSide, the best massive-multiplayer first-person shooter
(MMOFPS) out there. Let's get started!

**NOTE:** Offline training *does not* work at present. Just completely
ignore offline training. Everything you could learn from offline
training, you will learn in game.

Start out by logging in and choosing your nearest server and your
preferred [Empire](Empire "wikilink"), throw in a name, pick a face and
voice, and head into sanctuary.

## VR training!

When you spawn in your [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink"), walk out the
door and take a sharp left or right, and walk around the corner of that
same building. You'll see a set of three doors up some stairs; head into
any of them.

Choose 1 or 2 (do both). Every new item you <i>equip</i> gives you a
number of [Experience Points](Experience_Points "wikilink")- anywhere
between 50 and 200. So equip every [weapon](Weapons_Index "wikilink")
and support item you can, fire them if you want to. Putting on
[Rexo](Rexo "wikilink") armor makes this process faster.

-   Don't forget, each [MAX Armor](MAX "wikilink") has its own weapon
    systems, and they award you [Experience
    Points](Experience_Points "wikilink") also.

To leave VR, hop into one of those prism-looking beams.

Same goes for vehicles; you'll spawn next to the ground vehicle pad.
Drive everything. If it has a gunner spot, park and hop in the gunner
slot too.

When you're done, visit the [BFR](BFR "wikilink") shack (just a touch
northeast of the vehicle pad) and use both battle frames. if you want to
switch out weapons, walk it over to the rearm silo behind the ground
vehicle pad you were just using, it's on the hill to the east of the
vehicle-pad.

Then head to the airpad, it's a good distance, heading west by
southwest. It's up on a hill, use your map to pinpoint it. There, do the
same thing. fly everything, use all the gunner seats.

By the time you finish this, you'll have gone from [BR1 to
BR4](Battle_Rank "wikilink"), and you'll be up to seven [Certification
points](Certification_points "wikilink").

## Load up and ship out

From your spawn point, head towards the massive, blocky, looming
building, known as the [HART Building](HART "wikilink"). Inside, find a
[Certification Terminal](Certification_Terminal "wikilink") and get some
[Certifications](Certifications "wikilink"). Don't worry, they're not
permanent (as a new character, you can switch them as often as you want
during your first week).

Then find an [Equipment terminal](Equipment_terminal "wikilink"), just
like in the VR shooting range. Get [agile](Agile_Exo-Suit "wikilink")
armor (at least), and load up on gear. When you have a suitable loadout,
switch to the favorites tab and save the configuration. Next time, you
can run up to the terminal, hit G then the number key, and you're good
to go.

If you know where you want to go, get on the [HART](HART "wikilink")
when it comes in (every 5 minutes). You'll hear it. If you don't, hit
escape and use "instant action." That will [spawn](spawn "wikilink") you
at a facility near a hotspot, putting your personal (white) waypoint on
where it thinks the fight is. This isn't 100% accurate, because humans
are unpredictable, but it usually will get you some action.

## In the field

Your [Map](Continental_Map "wikilink") will always save you. M key by
default, it shows hot spots - where there's gunfire. Also, you can
right-click anywhere on it to set a personal
[waypoint](waypoint "wikilink"), making navigation easier.

Communication is the second thing you'll run into. There are a number of
text commands you can use to talk on different channels. The backspace
key replies to /tell, and /s is for squad chat. There's a full list
[here](In-Game_Commands "wikilink").

## Other Tips

-   Q is autorun or 100% thrust (except in a BFR, where it's \`).
-   The U key pulls up your character info.
-   Alt+N toggles on outfit names.
-   \[ and \] zoom in and out on your minimap.
-   Use AI ammo (white) on infantry, use AP (gold) on maxes and
    vehicles. this doesn't change, regardless of how much armor they
    have.
-   You can tell rank by armor color. Brighter (more gold/red/green) is
    higher.
