[Certification points](Certification_points.md "wikilink") are what players
use to acquire [certifications](certifications.md "wikilink").
[Certifications](Certifications.md "wikilink") are what gives players
access to different weapons, armor, vehicles and abilities.

Starting characters ([Battle Rank](Battle_Rank.md "wikilink") 1) begin with
seven (7) [Certification points](Certification_points.md "wikilink"). As
each [Battle Rank](Battle_Rank.md "wikilink") is earned (with the exception
of Battle Rank 6, 12, 18, 24, 25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38), so is a
new Certification point, up to a maximum of 34 at Battle Rank 39. At
Battle Rank 40, all certifications will automatically become available
to a player, removing the use certification points.

If you choose to "forget" one of your
[certifications](certifications.md "wikilink"), the [certification
points](certification_points.md "wikilink") spent on it become immediately
available to be spend on other
[certifications](certifications.md "wikilink"). If you "forget" a
certification that is a prerequisite for another certification you have,
both will be forgotten automatically.

_Example: If you "forget" [Armored Assault
I](Armored_Assault_I.md "wikilink"); [Armored Assault
II](Armored_Assault_II.md "wikilink"), [Flail](Flail.md "wikilink"),
[BattleFrame Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics.md "wikilink"), [BFR
Anti-Infantry](BFR_Anti.$1.md "wikilink") and [BFR
Anti-Aircraft](BFR_Anti.$1.md "wikilink") will also be forgotten if
you have them certed._ Note, however, that you will not be able to
"forget" another certification for 6 hours.

Characters newer than 7 days, can unlearn certifications without
penalty. After those 7 days however, the 6 hour timer will apply.
Occasionally, your character may be granted a "Forget All" option,
normally coinciding with the release of a major
[patch](patch.md "wikilink"), enabling a one-time reset of all
certification points.
