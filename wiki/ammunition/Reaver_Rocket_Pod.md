**Reaver Rocket Pod**

These rockets are used by the [Reaver](../vehicles/Reaver.md)'s rocket pod
weapon. It does decent damage to both [infantry](../terminology/Infantry.md)
and [vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md). The boxes can be obtained from any
[Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded
into the [vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md)'s [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or
acquired while in the vehicle from a [Landing
Pad](../items/Landing_Pad.md).
