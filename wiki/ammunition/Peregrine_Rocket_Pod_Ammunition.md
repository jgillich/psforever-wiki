**Peregrine Rocket Pod Ammunition**

These rockets are used by the anti-infantry gunner weapon on the
[Peregrine](../Peregrine.md). They do reasonable damage to both
infantry and armor and have a small splash damage area. The boxes can be
obtained from any [Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to
be hand-loaded into the Peregrine's [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or
acquired while in the vehicle from a [Repair/Rearm.md
Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
