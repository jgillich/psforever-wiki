**Peregrine Anti Tank Machinegun Bullets**

This ammo is used by the
[Anti-Tank Machine Gun](../weapons/Anti-Tank_Machine_Gun.md), which is the
anti-armor pilot weapon of the [Peregrine](../vehicles/Peregrine.md) and
[Eagle](../vehicles/Eagle.md). The bullets do impressive damage at close range,
but suffer large [damage reductions](../terminology/Damage_Degradation.md) at
longer ranges. The boxes can be obtained from any
[Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
[BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md)'s [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or
acquired while in the BFR from a
[Repair/Rearm Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
