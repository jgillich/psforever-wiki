**Rocket Pod**

Rockets are self-propelled explosive devices launched from the
[Punisher](../weapons/Punisher.md) or [Rocklet Rifle](../weapons/Rocklet_Rifle.md).
Unlike grenades, a rocket travel in a straight line until it strikes an object
or burns all of its fuel. At this point, the rocket will explode. Rocket Pods
can be acquired at any [equipment terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) by
any [empire](../terminology/Empire.md). Rockets are effective against both
infantry and armored targets.

Because Rockets are considered anti-vehicular weapons, they _cannot_ pass though
the energy shields of
[BattleFrame Robotics](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md).
