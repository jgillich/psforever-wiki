**Flux Battery**

This battery pack is used by the [Thresher](../vehicles/Thresher.md) and
[Leviathan](../vehicles/Leviathan.md). The
[Flux Cannon](../weapons/Flux_Cannon.md) that fires this ammunition on each
vehicle differs significantly. The boxes can be obtained from any
[Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
[vehicle](../vehicles/index.md)'s [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or acquired
while in the vehicle from a [Repair/Rearm Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
