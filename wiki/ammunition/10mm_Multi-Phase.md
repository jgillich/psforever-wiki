**10mm Multi-Phase**

10mm Bullets are used by the empire-specific [Medium
Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md) pistols. These bullets have greater
stopping power than their 9mm counterparts. They do high damage to
infantry and [MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) units, but low damage against
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) and equipment.
