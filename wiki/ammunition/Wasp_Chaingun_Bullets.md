**Wasp Chaingun Bullets**

These 12mm bullets are used only by the [Wasp](../vehicles/Wasp.md). They are
meant for anti-aircraft duty, but do decent damage to ground
[vehicles](../vehicles/index.md) and
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) units. The bullets do minimal
damage to [infantry](../terminology/Infantry.md), requiring two clips to kill a
soldier wearing [Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) armor.
The boxes can be obtained from any
[Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
Wasp's [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or acquired while in the vehicle from a
[Landing Pad](../items/Landing_Pad.md).
