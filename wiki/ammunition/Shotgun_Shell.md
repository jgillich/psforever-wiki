**Shotgun Shell**

Shotgun Shells are, as the name indicates, the ammunition used by Shotguns. A
Shotgun Shell contains multiple small pellets that, when fired, are fired at the
target. Because these pellets spread out after being fired, it is important to
be as close to the target as possible, as to minimize the amount of pellets
missing their target. Due to this, Shotguns are used primarily indoors and in
other close combat fights, as they are very ineffective at anything beyond close
proximity.

The Standard Shotgun Shells are best against non-armored targets, and will do
minimum damage to anything that has more armor than a
[Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md). In those circumstances,
[Armor Piercing Shotgun Shells](Armor_Piercing_Shotgun_Shell.md) are suggested.

Because Shotgun Shells are only used in small arms, they can penetrate the
shields of a [BattleFrame Robotic](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md).
