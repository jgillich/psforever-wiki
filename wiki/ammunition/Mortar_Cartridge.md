**Mortar Cartridge**

These cartridges are used by the
[Ground Pounder](../terminology/Ground_Pounder.md) weapon found on the
[Galaxy Gunship](../vehicles/Galaxy_Gunship.md) and the
[Terran Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md)'s
[Marauder](../vehicles/Marauder.md)

[Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
vehicle's [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or acquired while in the vehicle from
a [Repair/Rearm Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
