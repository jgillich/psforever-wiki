**Liberator and Vulture Bombs**

These bombs are used in the [Liberator](../vehicles/Liberator.md) and
[Vulture](../vehicles/Vulture.md) bombers. The Liberator can drop anti-infantry
cluster bombs or tank buster bombs. The Vulture can only drop tank buster bombs,
but these are more powerful than the Liberator's version. The boxes can be
obtained from any [Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be
hand-loaded into the aircraft's [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or acquired
while in the vehicle from a [Landing Pad](../items/Landing_Pad.md).
