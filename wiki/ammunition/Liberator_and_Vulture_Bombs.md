**Liberator and Vulture Bombs**

These bombs are used in the [Liberator](../Liberator.md) and
[Vulture](../vehicles/Vulture.md) bombers. The Liberator can drop
anti-infantry cluster bombs or tank buster bombs. The Vulture can only
drop tank buster bombs, but these are more powerful than the Liberator's
version. The boxes can be obtained from any [Equipment
Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
aircraft's [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or acquired while in the vehicle
from a [Landing Pad](items/Landing_Pad.md).
