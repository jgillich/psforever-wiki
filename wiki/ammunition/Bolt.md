**Bolt**

Bolt Ammunition is large caliber ammunition for use in the
[Bolt Driver](../weapons/Bolt_Driver.md) and
[Heavy Scout Rifle](../weapons/Heavy_Scout_Rifle.md). Bolt ammo is considerably
larger than regular rifle or pistol ammunition, and as such, it causes more
damage to all targets. Furthermore, because of it's increased power over regular
ammunition, weapons firing bolt ammunition have a large increase in
[cone of fire](../terminology/Cone_of_fire.md) after each shot.

Since Bolt Ammunition is for use in small arms, it can pass though the energy
shields of [BattleFrame Robotics](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md).
