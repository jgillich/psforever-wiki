**Wasp Air-to-Air Missile**

These missiles are used by the [Wasp](../vehicles/Wasp.md). They can only be
fired when an air-to-air lock-on is achieved and does a rather large amount of
damage. The boxes can be obtained from any
[Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
[vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md)'s [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or acquired
while in the vehicle from a [Landing Pad](../items/Landing_Pad.md).
