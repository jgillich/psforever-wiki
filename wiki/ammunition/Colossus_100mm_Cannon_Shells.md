**Colossus 100mm Cannon Shells**

These shells are used by the [Dual 100mm
Cannons](../weapons/Dual_100mm_Cannons.md) on the
[Colossus](../vehicles/Colossus.md), which is the anti-armor gunner weapon.
The weapon is almost identical to the 100mm cannons on the
[Prowler](../vehicles/Prowler.md), though it does much less damage to
infantry. The boxes can be obtained from any [Equipment
Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
[vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md)'s [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or acquired
while in the vehicle from a [Repair/Rearm.md
Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
