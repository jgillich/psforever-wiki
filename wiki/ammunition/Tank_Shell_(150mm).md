**Tank Shell (150mm)**

These tank shells are used by the [Vanguard](../vehicles/Vanguard.md). They do
massive damage to infantry and armor alike, though the heavy shells have a slow
velocity. The boxes can be obtained from any
[Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
Vanguard's [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or acquired while in the vehicle
from a [Repair/Rearm Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
