**Peregrine Particle Cannon Ammunition**

This ammo is used by the [Particle Cannon](../weapons/Particle_Cannon.md), which
is the anti-armor gunner weapon of the [Peregrine](../vehicles/Peregrine.md).
The rounds are the most damaging anti-armor rounds in the game. After impact,
the rounds leave a minor irradiation field behind for a few seconds, eating away
at the armor of anything inside. The boxes can be obtained from any
[Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
[BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md)'s [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or
acquired while in the BFR from a
[Repair/Rearm Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
