**Colossus Mortar Launcher Shells**

These rockets are used by the anti-infantry gunner weapon on the
[Colossus](../vehicles/Colossus.md). They do reasonable damage to both infantry
and armor and have a small splash damage area. The boxes can be obtained from
any [Equipment Terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into
the BFR's [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) or acquired while in the vehicle from
a [Repair/Rearm Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
