**Flail**

The **Flail** is an [Ancient-Tech](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) (AT)
artillery platform. It has fairly high armor but travels at a low speed. The
Flail must be [deployed](../terminology/Deploy.md), immobilizing it, to fire its
devastating long-range energy projectiles. When not deployed it cannot fire its
weapon and is therefore defenseless. The vehicle can only deploy on land, though
its ability to hover allows it to travel across inland stretches of water, but
it cannot travel far beyond the coast of a continent. The farther its
projectiles travel, the more damage they do (inverse
[Damage Degradation](../terminology/Damage_Degradation.md)). The Flail works
best when supported by a squad leader of
[Command Rank 1 (CR1)](../terminology/Command_Rank.md) or a squad member
utilizing the [Laze Pointer](../weapons/Laze_Pointer.md) to help it acquire a
target. Both of these systems give the Flail driver a special triangle shaped
target. Unfortunately, squad leader waypoints show the aim zone as it would be
if the target was at sea-level while the Laze Pointer, though harder to use,
shows the Flail user an aim point which is set to the elevation above sea-level
of the target, allowing the Flail user's first shot to hit. A third way of
targeting is done by the squad leader assigning the squad experience waypoint
(blue diamond) to a particular squad member (done in the "manage" tab). An
aiming point will be produced for the flail and provides_perfect_targeting
information like the [laze pointer](../weapons/Laze_Pointer.md). Note however,
that you will be targeting the feet of your own squad member!

Laze Pointers may be obtained from the Flail itself, as well as all
[Equipment terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md), and do not require any special
[Certifications](../certifications/Certifications.md) to use.

The Flail requires a [Vehicle Module](../etc/Vehicle_Module.md) lattice benefit,
or linked [Cavern Lock Benefit](../etc/Cavern_Lock.md) in order to be
purchasable on the surface. To recharge the Flail's capacitor, you must go to a
[Repair/Rearm Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md) at a facility that has the
[Vehicle Module](../etc/Vehicle_Module.md) benefit, or use a
[Vehicle Energy Crystal](../terminology/Vehicle_Energy_Crystal.md) in the
[Caverns](../locations/Caverns.md).
