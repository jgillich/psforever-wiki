**Mosquito**

The **Mosquito** is a fast, agile, and lightly armored scout craft. It carries
only a 12mm light rotary chaingun, but it can easily slip past automated
defenses (it's not visible on enemy radar).

Additionally, the Mosquito carries radar capable of picking up enemy troops at
fairly long range and transmitting that information to nearby friendly forces,
causing enemy troops to be shown on other players'
[Proximity Maps](../terminology/Proximity_Map.md).

The onboard radar works only at thrust settings of 50% or lower, and may not
pick up motionless or [shielded](../implants/Sensor_Shield.md) enemies.
