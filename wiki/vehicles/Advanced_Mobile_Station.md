**Advanced Mobile Station (AMS)**

The **Advanced Mobile Station (AMS)** provides a mobile
[spawn point](../terminology/Spawn_point.md), giving greater flexibility than the fixed spawn
points of [Towers](../locations/Towers.md) and
[Facilities](../locations/Facilities.md). Also adding to its benefits, it has a
five-second shorter spawn time than [Towers](../locations/Towers.md), making
them even more useful.

When deployed, it is surrounded by a cloaking "bubble" making it impossible to
see except when very close to it. Undeployed, it is very visible, ponderous, and
while well-armored, not apt to survive very long in the field.

Early designs featured two [spawn tubes](../items/Respawn_Tube.md) on either
side, but more recent designs allow soldiers to spawn anywhere within the
cloaking bubble. As of [2.7.6](../patches/2.7.6.md), the **AMS** also features
two [equipment terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) (on either side of the
vehicle), a [matrix terminal](../items/Matrix_Panel.md) to bind
soldier's DNA (at the front) and a [respawn panel](../terminology/Respawn_panel.md) (at the
rear).

Virtually no offensive assault—and many defensive stands—can be successful
without one or more well-placed **AMSes**.
