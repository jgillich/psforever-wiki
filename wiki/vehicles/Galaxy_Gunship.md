**Galaxy Gunship**

The Galaxy Gunship is a modified [Galaxy](Galaxy.md) airframe with heavy guns,
and more armor. The gunship takes only 75% of all damage incident on it, making
its effective armor much stronger than the regular Galaxy without increasing
repair time much.

The gunship sports three 35mm chainguns and 2
[Ground Pounders](../terminology/Ground_Pounder.md). It lacks the
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) passenger slots and cargo bay of
the original Galaxy. The Galaxy Gunship is a beast on the battlefield, able to
take on almost any single target at close to medium range. A single
anti-aircraft platform is no match for the gunship.

The Galaxy Gunship can only be purchased at a
[Dropship Center](../locations/Dropship_Center.md) or the
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md). The purchase timer is 10 minutes.
