**Liberator**

The Liberator bomber, often called simply a "Lib" or "Libby," is crewed by three
soldiers: the pilot, the bombardier, and the tailgunner.

The pilot has a 35mm cannon that may be suitable for attacking ground targets,
and the tailgunner possesses a pivoting 25mm machine gun that is normally used
to fend off aerial attacks from the rear. The gun however is positioned such
that the tail of the craft restricts its vertical arc of fire considerably.

The bombardier is capable of firing payloads of two different bomb types: the
tankbuster, which travels to the surface as a single bomb and creates a fairly
concentrated zone of damage that is suitable for damaging vehicular targets, and
the cluster bomb, which separates into nine smaller 'bomblets' at a
predetermined altitude, creating a larger zone of damage suitable for attacking
groups of infantry.

However, the bombardier may only launch bombs when the Liberator is flying level
and at a safe altitude.

A skilled bombardier may be capable of landing an entire magazine of ten bombs
on a single point, depending on flight trajectory. By slewing his or her view
forward or aft, the release path of the bombs is altered.

The Liberator requires a [Technology Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md)
lattice link or [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) vehicle pad in order to
be purchasable.
