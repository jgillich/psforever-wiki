**BattleFrame Robotics**, or **BFR** for short, is the name given the giant
robots (or mecha) of the PlanetSide universe.

### The Story

In the story, the technology for BattleFrame Robotics was originally developed
on Earth by the [Terran Republic](../terminology/Terran_Republic.md). However, the
technology could not be perfected there. The republic of Earth then sent the
schematics for BFRs through the micro-wormhole between Earth and the Auraxian
System to the three warring empires of Auraxis. Each side received the
schematics, and began making their own variants of the technology.

The [Terran Republic](../terminology/Terran_Republic.md) developed the
[Colossus](Colossus.md). The [Vanu Sovereignty](../terminology/Vanu_Sovereignty.md)
developed the [Aphelion](Aphelion.md). The
[New Conglomerate](../terminology/New_Conglomerate.md) developed the
[Peregrine](Peregrine.md).

However, the systems of a BFR were very complicated, proving to be too much of a
burden for a single pilot. The [Auraxian Core](../items/Auraxian_Core.md) had
felt the deaths of all the prototype BFR pilots, and sent the empires of Auraxis
a message. This message came in the form of [Monoliths](../items/Monolith.md)
that spawned [Resonance Crystals](../terminology/Resonance_Crystals.md) that
allowed a single pilot to control the complex systems of a BFR. Each empire
adapted the crystals into their soldiers, and the empires of Auraxis were able
to field BFRs and develop tactics for their use, as well as their defeat.

### What is a BFR?

BFRs themselves are robotic vehicles that move via a walking mechanism, are
armed with two guns on their arms, and are protected by a powerful shield. These
steel titans are driven by a single pilot, and are often perceived as an
unstoppable one-man death machine.

BFRs are the only vehicle in PlanetSide that utilize hitbox technology, allowing
a hit to a specific region of the BFR to damage a specific system (guns,
sensors, transit mode, and shields are the systems that can be damaged, although
a fifth hitbox allows items in the trunk such as ammunition to be destroyed).
While the shields regenerate automatically over time, a BFR system that is
damaged can only be restored by repairing the BFR.

Additionally, [Jammer grenades](../weapons/Jammer_Grenade.md) and
[EMP](../terminology/EMP.md) blasts can temporarily cripple a BFR, causing it to
move and fire much more slowly, and in the case of the flight variants,
completely disabling the flight systems until the effect wears off.

### The Variants

There are two kinds of variants: the **gunner variant** (or basic BFR) and the
**flight variant**.

#### Gunner variants

Gunner variants have, in addition to the pilot weapons, an extra gunner pod on
their backs which can be manned by a second soldier. They also have more armor
and a faster shield regeneration rate than their flight counterparts, which
gives them greater "staying power."

In the gunner variant, the shields will be activated whenever a soldier enters
either the pilot or gunner's seat, and will remain active as long one or both of
these positions is occupied. Emptying both positions will deactivate the
shields, leaving the BFR directly vulnerable to attack or
[jacking](../terminology/Jack.md).

There is a [known issue](../archive/Known_Issues.md) regarding the gunner no being
able to aim left and right. However, this is a fairly rare bug.

##### Empire-specific gunner variants

- The [Colossus](Colossus.md) ([Terran Republic](../terminology/Terran_Republic.md))
- The [Peregrine](Peregrine.md) ([New Conglomerate](../terminology/New_Conglomerate.md))
- The [Aphelion](Aphelion.md) ([Vanu Sovereignty](../terminology/Vanu_Sovereignty.md))

#### Flight variants

Flight variants are single-pilot BFRs with a flight pack on their backs to allow
the BFR to fly vertically for a short amount of time (in a similar manner to the
[VS](../terminology/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) [MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md)
units' jump-jets). The flight systems are powered by the "BFR capacitor", which
is measured with a small bar on the player's [HUD](../terminology/Heads-up_Display.md).
The capacitor recharges over time when the flight systems are not in use. When a
flight variant uses its flight systems, the shields are deactivated for the
entire time the BFR is in the air, reactivating once it lands. Additionally, the
shield levels will be drained as long as the BFR is in flight. The BFR can
remain airborne until the capacitor is drained, then it will begin dropping back
to the ground.

Flight variants have much less armor and take a larger amount of time to
regenerate their shields compared to their gunner counterparts. Conversely,
flight variants can run and walk much faster than the ground variants, giving
them the ability to flee relatively quickly when under attack. Each empire
variant's maximum jump height is different, with the
[Invader](../items/Invader.md) having the highest jump and the
[Eclipse](Eclipse.md) having the lowest.

##### Empire-specific flight variants

- The [Invader](../items/Invader.md)
  ([Terran Republic](../terminology/Terran_Republic.md))
- The [Eagle](Eagle.md) ([New Conglomerate](../terminology/New_Conglomerate.md))
- The [Eclipse](Eclipse.md) ([Vanu Sovereignty](../terminology/Vanu_Sovereignty.md))

### BFR Certification

In order to certify to get a BFR, a pilot must first get a
[BFR Imprint](../terminology/BFR_Imprint.md) down in the
[caverns](../locations/Caverns.md) if the character was created after June
18, 2009. Also, [Armored Assault I](../certifications/Armored_Assault_I.md) and
[Armored Assault II](../certifications/Armored_Assault_II.md) are required to
gain the BattleFrame Robotics certification.

Anti-Vehicular (AV) pilot weapons come with the basic BFR certification (4 cert
points), as well as the two possible gunner weapons (AV and Anti-Infantry (AI)).
In order to get AI and Anti-Aircraft pilot weapons, 1 cert point must be spent
for each individually.

To obtain a flight variant, one must earn the [BFR
Basic]../merits/BFR\_(Merit).md) [merit](../merits/index.md),
which involves scoring 100 unique kills and then a kill streak of 15 with the
BFR pilot weapons.

BFR timers take 25 minutes from the time of original purchase until another BFR
can be acquired. The timer is reduced to 15 minutes if a
[Vehicle Module](../modules/Vehicle_Module.md) is installed, or the base is
receiving a [Cavern Lock](../terminology/Cavern_Lock.md) Benefit.
