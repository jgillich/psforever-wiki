**Router**

The **Router** is a [deployable](../terminology/Deploy.md) teleporter system
similar to the [Teleporters](../terminology/Teleporter.md) of the caverns. The
Router will allow friends (and foes) to utilize its teleporter beam to instantly
move between where the [Telepad](../weapons/Telepad.md) is deployed and the
Router.

The Telepad is acquired from a terminal in the back and takes up a pistol slot.
The Telepad is simple to deploy, simply push the button of its holster and click
where you wish to deploy it. The Telepad can only be deployed within a limited
range of the Router (300 meters). One minute after you click, the Telepad will
become operational allowing non-[IFF](../terminology/IFF.md) transport. To let
others take telepads from your Router, set the [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md)
to empire or group. Placing a telepad renders any active telepads from the same
Router inactive, so be careful who you let have access.

Like most other vehicles, the Router will automatically deconstruct after five
minutes if it loses ownership.

Despite being an [Ancient Tech](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) vehicle,
the Router can be spawned anywhere an [AMS](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) can
(does not require a [Vehicle Module](../etc/Vehicle_Module.md) or
[Cavern Lock](../etc/Cavern_Lock.md)). Similar to an
[AMS](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md), you can gain
[Support Experience Points](../terminology/Support_Experience_Points.md) by
owning a deployed Router (or deploying a [Telepad](../weapons/Telepad.md) for
one) that friendlies use and then go on to score kills.

The Router can be loaded in a [Lodestar](Lodestar.md), but you must drive it in
sideways (after you lower the gate, turn and strafe your way in) to work. The
router, like all [Ancient Tech](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) vehicles,
can travel over water (but cannot deploy on water). Due to its small saucer-like
cross section and relatively heavy armor, the router can be difficult to
destroy.
