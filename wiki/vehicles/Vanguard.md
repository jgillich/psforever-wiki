**Vanguard**

The Vanguard is the [New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md)'s
[Medium Battle Tank](../items/Medium_Battle_Tank.md). It has a low side profile
and is the most heavily armored MBT. Its gunner can switch between two guns. Its
main gun does a lot of damage but fires slowly. This makes it hard to engage
moving targets and important that the first shot is a hit. The secondary gun is
dual 20mm cannons that is useful against aircraft or targets at large distances.

The Vanguard requires a [Technology Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md)
lattice link or [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) vehicle pad in order to
be purchasable.

Shots to kill (with 150mm Cannon only):

|                           |          |
| ------------------------- | -------- |
| [Lightning](Lightning.md) | 4 shots  |
| [Prowler](Prowler.md)     | 10 shots |
| [Magrider](Magrider.md)   | 8 shots  |
