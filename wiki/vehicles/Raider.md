**Raider**

The Raider variant developed by the [Terran Republic](../factions/Terran_Republic.md)
features four 15mm chainguns. The new 15mm ammo does equal damage to infantry
and armor, and does well against aircraft also. With a full gun-crew, the Raider
is fearsome on the battefield. Like the [Deliverer](Deliverer.md), the Raider
has adequate trunk space and can cross calm rivers and waterways by floating at
the surface.

**Introduced: May 27, 2004 with update version [2.7.6](../patches/2.7.6.md).**

**Trivia: The Raider was called "BattleWagon" when it was first released,
however, due to complaints about this name, it was later changed to "Raider".**
