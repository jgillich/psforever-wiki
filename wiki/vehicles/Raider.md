**Raider**

The Raider variant developed by the [Terran
Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md) features four 15mm chainguns. The
new 15mm ammo does equal damage to infantry and armor, and does well
against aircraft also. With a full gun-crew, the Raider is fearsome on
the battefield. Like the [Deliverer](Deliverer.md), the Raider
has adequate trunk space and can cross calm rivers and waterways by
floating at the surface.

**Introduced: May 27, 2004 with update version
[2.7.6](2.md.7.6).**

**Trivia: The Raider was called "BattleWagon" when it was first
released, however, due to complaints about this name, it was later
changed to "Raider".**
