Gunner variants have, in addition the the pilot weapons, an extra gunner pod on
their backs where a second soldier can mount a secondary gun mounted atop the
BFR. They also have more armor and a faster shield regeneration then their
flight counter parts giving them more of a "staying power."

The Flight Variant of the Colossus is the [Invader](../items/Invader.md).

## **Pilot Weapons**

The pilot weapons available to the Colossus are

- The [Tank Defense Cannon](../weapons/Tank_Defense_Cannon.md) (Anti-Vehicular)
- The [Rotary Chaingun](../items/Rotary_Chaingun.md) (Anti-Infantry)
- The [Burster](../items/Burster_(BFR).md) (Anti-Aircraft)
- The [NTU Siphon](../weapons/NTU_Siphon.md)
- The [Armor Siphon](../weapons/Armor_Siphon.md) (Anti-Vehicular)

The pilot has room for two such weapons at a time and can be two of the same
weapon, or two different weapons.

## **Gunner Weapons**

- The [Dual 100mm Cannons](../weapons/Dual_100mm_Cannons.md) (Anti-Vehicular)
- The [Mortar Launcher](../weapons/Mortar_Launcher.md) (Anti-Infantry)
