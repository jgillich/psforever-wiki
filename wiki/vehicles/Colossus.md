Gunner variants have, in addition the the pilot weapons, an extra gunner
pod on their backs where a second soldier can mount a secondary gun
mounted atop the BFR. They also have more armor and a faster shield
regeneration then their flight counter parts giving them more of a
"staying power."

The Flight Variant of the Colossus is the [Invader](../items/Invader.md).
