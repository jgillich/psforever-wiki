**Phantasm**

The Phantasm is cloaked troop transport that requires a
[Technology Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md) link or
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) [Air Terminal](../items/Air_Terminal.md)
to be purchasable. It can carry 4 passengers and can be cloaked by the pilot by
pressing the "B" key by default.

Traveling at speeds greater than 40 km/h (between 20% and 30% throttle) will
make the [vehicle](Vehicle.md) slightly visible (note that at 30% throttle (42
km/h) you will appear cloaked on your screen but others will see a slight
outline). Strafing, rising, or descending while traveling over 14 km/h will also
expose the aircraft. Traveling at speeds above 50% throttle will create visible
contrails on the wings of aircraft and enemies can easily see it at great
distances.

Note that there is a bug where sometimes enemies can see the phantasm's opacity
as if it were traveling at 100% throttle even if it is nearly stationary. This
is annoying as not all enemies are affected, but if one sees you and starts
shooting, many others follow. One tactic to combat this bug, if you notice
enemies at great distance shooting your stationary phantasm, is to descend so
that your landing struts extend. This sometimes fixes the bug. If that doesn't
work, you need to fly past the drawing distance of the enemies, get out of the
vehicle, then get in again.

The Phantasm has the greatest sustainable speed of any aircraft in the game.
Over reasonable distances, it is the only aircraft other than the
[Wasp](Wasp.md) that can outrun a [Mosquito](Mosquito.md) if the afterburner is
applied optimally. The trade-off is that the Phantasm has very poor acceleration
and deceleration, thus changes in speed must be planned well in advance
(especially when preparing to land).

Lock-on weapons are ineffective against the Phantasm while cloaked, though
[Flak](../weapons/Flak.md) will still explode in proximity to it. Automated
defense systems will not fire on a cloaked phantasm. An enemy cloaked phantasm
inside the [SOI](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md) of a base with
[interlink](../locations/Interlink.md)
[benefits](../terminology/Facility_Linked_Benefit.md) will show up on the
[proximity map](../terminology/Proximity_Map.md) of friendly players.

The pilot can wear up to [Agile Exo-Suit](../armor/Agile_Exo-Suit.md) armor, and
can earn the [Galaxy Support Pilot](../merits/Galaxy_Support_Pilot.md)
[merit](../merits/index.md) for kills made by players after they
bail from the aircraft.
