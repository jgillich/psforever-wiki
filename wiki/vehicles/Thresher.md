**Thresher**

The **Thresher** and its capibility to hover makes it the fastest and most agile
of all the empire specific [Assault buggies](category:_Vehicles.md#Buggies).

Designed for a two-person crew, a driver and a gunner position are oriented
side-by-side.

The gunner has access to the top-mounted "Flux Cannon," capable of firing at
high speeds in the full arc of horizontal motion. With a magazine of 100 rounds,
the gunner can fire for a good length without reloading.

Driving the Thresher is similar to driving and maneuvering other
[Hovercraft](../terminology/Hovercraft.md). The open cockpit allows the driver
and the gunner to wear up to
[Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md).
