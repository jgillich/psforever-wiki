**Vindicator**

The _Vindicator_ is the New Conglomerate's heavy troop transport vehicle. It
features 2 75mm and 2 20mm Cannons on the top and 2
[Ballguns](../items/Ballgun.md) on the side. The Vindicator can pass through
enemy [Shield Module](../items/Shield_Module.md) defenses.

The 20mm Cannons are different from those found on the [Vanguard](Vanguard.md)
and [Deliverer](Deliverer.md). The Vindicator's 20 mm Cannons have a reduced
rate of fire, but do slightly more damage per shot than normal. These cannons
are best used against aircraft and vehicles, not infantry.

The driver can wear up to [Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md)
armor. The driver also has access to an [EMP](../terminology/EMP.md) blast (default
key: "b"). The capacitor must recharge before it can be fired again. The
capacitor status is shown on the [HUD](../terminology/Heads-up_Display.md) bar. The
driver can also activate the vehicle horn (default key: "f").

The side [Ballguns](../items/Ballgun.md) have a limited view, but if the user
has the [Darklight](../implants/Darklight.md)
[Implant](../implants/index.md), he/she can see
[cloaked](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md) enemies at a longer range than normal,
providing excellent side defense.
