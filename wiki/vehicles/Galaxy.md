**Galaxy**

![](../images/Galaxy_crew_seats.jpg "Galaxy_crew_seats.jpg"){ align=right width="350" }

The **Galaxy** is a huge aircraft capable of carrying 9 infantry and 2
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) units, as well as the pilot and
any passengers of vehicles in its cargo hold. A full squad can be transported
easily, leaving the driver and gunners to return for other passengers.

As pictured to the right, the Pilot sits in the nose of the aircraft, the
forward seat of the canopied cockpit. The tailgun operator mounts via the ladder
on the starboard fuselage, sitting behind him or her, operating the aft rotary
cannon remotely. The port and starboard nacelle guns are operated in a similar
manner by crewmembers sitting on the appropriate sides of the tailgunner,
accessible via doors in the fuselage.

The [Galaxy](Galaxy.md)  can only be purchased at a
[Dropship Center](../locations/Dropship_Center.md) or in the
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) and requires the
[Air Support](../certifications/Air_Support.md)
[certification](../certifications/Certifications.md).
