**Leviathan**

The _Leviathan_ is the Vanu Sovereignty's heavy troop transport vehicle. It
features 2 75mm and 2 [Flux Cannons](../weapons/Flux_Cannon.md) on the top and 2
[Ballguns](../items/Ballgun.md) on the side. The Leviathan can pass through
enemy [Shield Module](../items/Shield_Module.md) defenses.

The Flux Cannons are different than that fired from the [Thresher](Thresher.md)
in that the projectile speed is significantly faster, but the damage is slightly
reduced and has no splash damage. They are best used against enemy vehicles and
aircraft, not infantry.

The driver can wear up to [Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md)
armor. The driver also has access to an [EMP](../commands/EMP.md) blast (default
key: "b"). The capacitor must recharge before it can be fired again. The
capacitor status is shown on the [HUD](../etc/Heads-up_Display.md) bar. The
driver can also activate the vehicle horn (default key: "f").

The side [Ballguns](../items/Ballgun.md) have a limited view, but if the user
has the [Darklight](../implants/Darklight.md)
[Implant](../implants/Implants.md), he/she can see
[cloaked](../items/Infiltration_Suit.md) enemies at a longer range than normal,
providing excellent side defense.
