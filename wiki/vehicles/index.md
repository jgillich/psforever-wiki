# Vehicles

![
[Vanguard](Vanguard.md)
[Medium Battle Tank](../items/Medium_Battle_Tank.md).](../images/Vanguard_threefourths.jpg){ class="figure" } [Vehicles](index.md) are an essential part to
[PlanetSide](../PlanetSide.md) as they are the main mode of transport
between [facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) and are the most powerful units
on the battlefield. In PlanetSide, there are many different types of vehicles,
from mobile spawn points to huge lumbering robots to ten person APC's.

Planetside currently has 38 different ground and air vehicles (not including
[HART](../terminology/HART.md) shuttles and [Drop Pods](../items/Drop_Pod.md)),
each with radically different attributes. Almost every vehicle has at least one
type of onboard weapons system - the exceptions are the
[AMS](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md), [Lodestar](Lodestar.md),
[Phantasm](Phantasm.md), [Router](Router.md), and [Wraith](Wraith.md) (though
all have important capabilities). Some vehicles are only available to members of
a particular [Empire](../terminology/Empire.md), while others are available to
all. Any unoccupied vehicle may be [jacked](../terminology/Jack.md) (stolen) by
an enemy [advanced hacker](../certifications/Advanced_Hacking.md).

## Acquiring a Vehicle

Acquiring a vehicle in PlanetSide is slightly more involved than in other First
Person Shooters. Not everyone is qualified to drive every vehicle, and a player
must first go through a slight process before being able to acquire and drive a
vehicle.

### Certifications

Before you can even get a vehicle, you must have the correct
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md). Certain certifications
yield different vehicles, and while some of the certifications yield what
vehicle the certification name is, certain certifications come in "bundles".
Certain vehicles are also granted under multiple certifications, so careful
certification management is important when applying for certain vehicles.

The list of vehicular certifications is as follows:

- [ATV](ATV.md)
  - [Switchblade](<../certifications/Switchblade_(Certification).md>)
- [Harasser](Harasser.md)
- [Light Scout](../certifications/Light_Scout.md)
- [Assault Buggy](<../certifications/Assault_Buggy_(Certification).md>)
- [Armored Assault I](../certifications/Armored_Assault_I.md)
  - [Armored Assault II](../certifications/Armored_Assault_II.md)
    - [Flail](Flail.md)
    - [BattleFrame Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics.md)
      - [BFR Anti-Infantry](../certifications/BFR_Anti-Infantry.md)
      - [BFR Anti-Aircraft](../certifications/BFR_Anti-Aircraft.md)
- [Ground Transport](../certifications/Ground_Transport.md)
- [Ground Support](../certifications/Ground_Support.md)
- [Air Cavalry, Scout](../certifications/Air_Cavalry_Scout.md)
  - [Air Cavalry, Assault](../certifications/Air_Cavalry_Assault.md)
    ([Light Scout](../certifications/Light_Scout.md) can be used in place of Air
    Cavalry, Scout as a pre-requisite)
  - [Air Cavalry, Interceptor](../certifications/Air_Cavalry_Interceptor.md)
    (Light Scout can be used in place of Air Cavalry, Scout as a pre-requisite)
- [Air Support](../certifications/Air_Support.md)
  - [Galaxy Gunship](<../certifications/Galaxy_Gunship_(Certification).md>)
- [Phantasm](<../certifications/Phantasm_(Certification).md>) (requires
  [Infiltration Suit](<../certifications/Infiltration_Suit_(Certification).md>))

In addition, any player has access to the
[Advanced Nanite Transport](Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md).

### Merits

In addition to certifications, certain vehicles require the player to have a
certain [Merit Commendation](../merits/index.md) before they can
be purchased or driven.

The vehicles and their requirements are listed below:

[Vulture](Vulture.md) : [Bomber Ace Bronze](../merits/Bomber_Ace.md)
Flight-Variant BFRs ([Invader](Invader.md), [Eclipse](Eclipse.md), or
[Eagle](Eagle.md)) : [BFR Basic](<../merits/BFR_(Merit).md>)

### Vehicle Terminal

![ is a vehicle which requires a
[Technology Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md).](../images/NCmag.jpg){ class="figure" } Once a player has the correct certification, a player can
purchase the vehicle from a friendly or hacked
[Vehicle Terminal](../locations/Vehicle_Terminal.md). However, some Vehicle
Terminals are restricted to either air or ground vehicles, and some vehicles can
only be purchased when certain requirements are met. Also, after every vehicle
purchase, the same vehicle cannot be purchased for 5 minutes, unless you are at
a base which has a [Vehicle Module](../modules/Vehicle_Module.md), in which the
timer is reduced to 2:30.

In short, vehicles that are under
[Air Cavalry Scout](../certifications/Air_Cavalry_Scout.md),
[Air Cavalry Assault](../certifications/Air_Cavalry_Assault.md), the
[Liberator](Liberator.md) and the [Vulture](Vulture.md) from
[Air Support](../certifications/Air_Support.md) and the [Phantasm](Phantasm.md)
can be purchased at Air Vehicle Terminals. All of the above vehicles as well as
the [Galaxy](Galaxy.md) , [Galaxy Gunship](Galaxy_Gunship.md) and
[Lodestar](Lodestar.md) from [Air Support](../certifications/Air_Support.md) can
be purchased at a Dropship Vehicle Terminal. [BFR](BattleFrame_Robotics.md)'s
can only be purchased at [BFR Terminals](../items/BFR_Shed.md). Any other
vehicle can be purchased from a Ground Vehicle Terminal.

However, there are still some other restrictions. Certain vehicles require a
[Technology Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md) to be able to purchase
them, and therefore require the player to either be at a Technology Plant or
have a friendly Technology Plant linked to the base they are at through the
lattice. An Empire's [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) also counts as well.
The vehicles that are restricted by this are:

- [Reaver](Reaver.md)
- [Liberator](Liberator.md)
- [Vulture](Vulture.md)
- [Magrider](Magrider.md)
- [Vanguard](Vanguard.md)
- [Prowler](Prowler.md)
- [Skyguard](Skyguard.md)
- [Wasp](Wasp.md)
- [Phantasm](Phantasm.md)

Similarily, [Ancient Tech](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) vehicles can
only be purchased at a base with a [Vehicle Module](../modules/Vehicle_Module.md)
installed or at a base which has a link to a friendly base with a Vehicle Module
installed. Alternately, these vehicles can always be purchased in any of the six
[Core Combat](../items/Core_Combat.md) [caverns](../locations/Caverns.md). The
vehicles under this restriction are:

- [Switchblade](../items/Switchblade.md)
- [Flail](Flail.md)

### Armor Requirements

Certain vehicles require the driver to be wearing a certain type of armor. These
are considered "closed cockpit vehicles" and only accept a user wearing one of
the following armor types as the driver:

- [Infiltration Suit](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md)
- [Standard Exo-Suit](../armor/Standard_Exo-Suit.md)
- [Agile Exo-Suit](../armor/Agile_Exo-Suit.md)

Other vehicles have no such restriction, and allow the above armors as well as a
user wearing a [Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) to be the
driver. These are considered "open cockpit vehicles". The "open cockpit
vehicles" are:

- [Marauder](Marauder.md)
- [Thresher](Thresher.md)
- [Enforcer](Enforcer.md)
- [Skyguard](Skyguard.md)
- [Harasser](Harasser.md)
- [Fury](Fury.md)
- [Basilisk](Basilisk.md)
- [Wraith](Wraith.md)
- [Switchblade](../items/Switchblade.md)
- [Router](Router.md)
- [Flail](Flail.md)
- [Leviathan](Leviathan.md)
- [Vindicator](Vindicator.md)
- [Juggernaut](Juggernaut.md)

All other vehicles are considered to be closed cockpit vehicles.

## Keymapping

In PlanetSide, a player has to be very careful when remapping keys for vehicle
controls. There are four pages for controls for vehicles, and it is important to
understand what each of them do before making mistakes with your key bindings.

### Vehicle Controls

Vehicle controls are the keys that are used for all vehicles, regardless of
whether they are air or ground vehicles. The exception to this rule is
[BFR](BattleFrame_Robotics.md)'s, as they have their own key mapping and does
not use any of these key mappings.

These are the default Vehicle Controls.

### Ground Controls

These controls are for ground vehicles only. Ground vehicles use this control
set along with Vehicle Controls.

These are the default Ground Controls.

### Air Controls

These controls are used for air vehicles only. Air vehicles use this control set
along with Vehicle Controls.

These are the default Air Controls.

### BFR Controls

These controls are used only for BFR's. BFR's do not use the Vehicle Control set
and instead rely only on this control set to control the BFR's.

These are the default BFR Controls.

## Vehicle HUD Elements

When a player is inside of a vehicle, some new [HUD](../terminology/Heads-up_Display.md)
Elements show up. The Vehicle Armor Status icon defaults in the lower left hand
corner and shows up as an icon which represents your vehicle. This slowly turns
from green to red as your vehicle sustains damage. Alternately, this can be
turned into a simpler bar which becomes part of the bottom toolbar on the HUD.
With [BFR](BattleFrame_Robotics.md)'s, the icon also gives the player a status
on certain BFR subsystems, denoting their damage through colors, either green,
yellow, or red.

[BFR](BattleFrame_Robotics.md)'s and vehicles who had their shield generators
charged from an [Amp Station](../locations/Amp_Station.md)'s benefits have a
blue ring around their vehicle icon to show shield strength. Also, at the same
time, there is a blue bar at the bottom of the HUD on the toolbar to denote
shield strength as well.

After an [Advanced Nanite Transport](Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md) has gone to a
[warpgate](../locations/Warpgate.md) and gathered [NTU](../items/NTU.md)'s, a
gray bar which reads "NTU Level" shows up on the bottom toolbar. This denotes
how many NTU's are stored on the ANT that are ready to be transferred to an
[NTU Silo](../locations/NTU_Silo.md) at a
[facility](../locations/Facilities.md). Also, the [Mosquito](Mosquito.md) ,
[Reaver](Reaver.md), [Vulture](Vulture.md), [Galaxy](Galaxy.md) ,
[Phantasm](Phantasm.md), and [Lodestar](Lodestar.md) all have
[Afterburners](../terminology/Afterburner.md), which is denoted on the HUD by a
green bar which reads "Afterburners".

## Gunner and Passenger Spots

Most vehicles in [PlanetSide](../PlanetSide.md) are not solo vehicles;
rather, they have gunner and passenger slots to make them more
teamwork-oriented. In any vehicle, if the driver or any of the gunners scores a
kill, the driver and the gunners in the vehicle are also awarded
[Experience](../terminology/Experience.md). Also, a gunner or a passenger can always
bail from a vehicle, while a driver may not necessarily be able to.

### Gunner Slots

Gunner slots on a vehicle are denoted by a yellow circle around a Pistol symbol.
The owner of the vehicle can set who can get into a gunner position using the
Vehicle Management Pane. He can set the privacy to a number of levels, including
Empire, Squad, and Locked. All types of Armor, besides
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) armor can get into a gunner slot,
regardless of the vehicle.

Gunners are the main way a vehicle gets kills. While the Driver is the most
important slot, generally a driver's weapons, if he has any at all, are weaker
than a gunner's weapons. Thus, it is important for the gunner and the driver to
coordinate to get the most kills. Also, many of the best driver/gunner
combinations use a Voice Over IP program such as
[Teamspeak](../archive/TeamSpeak.md) or [Ventrilo](../archive/Ventrilo.md).

#### Merits Through Gunning

By gunning for a vehicle, a player can get certain merits. These merits are as
follows:

- [Ground Gunner](../merits/Ground_Gunner.md) (most ground vehicles)
- [Bombardier](<../merits/Bombardier_(Merit).md>) (Liberator and Vulture)
- [Air Defender](../merits/Air_Defender.md) (Skyguard)
- [Cavalry Pilot](../merits/Cavalry_Pilot.md) (Galaxy Gunship)

![troop transport.](../images/Galaxy_Side.jpg){ class="figure" }

### Passenger Slots

Other vehicles operate as transport vehicles, and have passenger slots. These
spots on a vehicle are denoted by a yellow circle with a chair inside it. Any
armor besides [MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) Armor can climb
into passenger slots and go for a ride. For new characters, this is probably the
easiest way to travel, as many new characters do not have the
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md) points required to acquire a
vehicle yet.

### MAX Passenger Slots

The [Leviathan](Leviathan.md),
[Juggernaut](Juggernaut.md),[Vindicator](Vindicator.md), and [Galaxy](Galaxy.md)
have two positions which can be occupied by players wearing
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) Armor. Players wearing a
[Infiltration Suit](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md),
[Standard Exo-Suit](../armor/Standard_Exo-Suit.md),
[Agile Exo-Suit](../armor/Agile_Exo-Suit.md), or a
[Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) may not utilze these
spots on a vehicle. These slots are denoted by a yellow circle with a MAX Icon
in the middle.

### Vehicle Bay

Both the [Galaxy](Galaxy.md) and the [Lodestar](Lodestar.md) have a vehicle bay
which can transport smaller ground vehicles in the air. The [Galaxy](Galaxy.md)
has a much smaller vehicle bay and can therefore only transport certain
vehicles. These vehicles are:

- [Advanced Nanite Transport](Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md)
- [Basilisk](Basilisk.md)
- [Fury](Fury.md)
- [Wraith](Wraith.md)
- [Switchblade](../items/Switchblade.md)
- [Harasser](Harasser.md)
- [Enforcer](Enforcer.md)
- [Marauder](Marauder.md)
- [Thresher](Thresher.md)
- [Skyguard](Skyguard.md)
- [Lightning](Lightning.md)

A [Lodestar](Lodestar.md) can carry any ground vehicle, including
[BFRs](BattleFrame_Robotics.md).

_Note: For a [Router](Router.md) to enter a [Lodestar](Lodestar.md), it must
strafe into the Lodestar sideways._
