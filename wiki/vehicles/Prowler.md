**Prowler**

The Prowler is the [Terran Republic](../factions/Terran_Republic.md)'s
[Medium Battle Tank](../items/Medium_Battle_Tank.md). It has a tall side profile
and can hold two gunners. Its two gunners can attack different targets at the
same time. Its main gun is a dual-100mm cannon. It fires fast, can be used at
short range and is particularly nasty against infantry, killing them in one hit.
The second gunner can act as spotter and provide mild defense against dispersed
infantry and aircraft using dual-15mm chainguns.

The Prowler requires a [Technology Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md)
lattice link or [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) vehicle pad in order to
be purchasable.

Shots to kill (with Dual 100mm Cannons only):
