**Vulture**

This close-support bomber is a modified [Liberator](Liberator.md) airframe. It
has a smaller payload but improved speed and handling, as well as afterburners.
It lacks the pilot's downward-facing 'bomber mode' camera and cannot equip
anti-infantry cluster bombs.

The pilot's 35mm nose cannon has a high rate of fire and more focused armor
damage, but is less damaging to infantry and aircraft. There also less rounds
per clip, with only 75 which can be completely spent in approximately 5 seconds.

The bombs that the Vulture carries are significantly more powerful against armor
than the anti-armor bombs of a standard Liberator. A standard A/V bomb does 600
damage, and the Vulture's bombs do 1500 damage. This increase in power is offset
by the fact that it carries less bombs and only permits five bombs per clip. The
release rate of the bombs is also somewhat slower, as it the fall speed.
Vultures can also release bombs at a slightly lower altitude than the Liberator.
Their combination of superior speed and maneuverability with the limitations of
bomb payload make the Vulture best suited to low level close support bombing.

The tailgun of the Vulture also differs from the Liberator. The Vulture's
tailgun holds only 100 rounds per clip instead of 150, but it is more powerful
than that of the liberator, and can be used against ground targets with much
success.

The [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) of the Vulture is slightly smaller than the
Liberator, able to carry 8 4x4 boxes instead of 9 like the Liberator. Because of
this, Liberator [favorites](../terminology/Favorites.md) cannot be seamlessly loaded
into the Vulture, requiring a seperate favorite slot for dedicated Vulture
users.

Only experienced Liberator pilots are cleared to operate Vulture. Obtaining one
from a flight vehicle terminal will require not only the
[Air Support](../certifications/Air_Support.md) certification, but also a
[Bomber Ace](../merits/Bomber_Ace.md) Bronze
[Merit Commendation](../merits/index.md). Like the Liberator, the
Vulture requires a [Technology Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md) lattice
link or [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) vehicle pad in order to be
purchasable.
