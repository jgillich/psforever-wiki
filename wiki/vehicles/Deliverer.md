**Deliverer**

While less maneuverable than assault buggies, the Deliverer has two gunners --
one next to the driver, facing forward, the other in the rear, covering the
back. A reasonable trunk provides adequate space to carry supplies as well. The
Deliverer also has the distinct advantage of being able to cross calm rivers and
waterways and will float at the surface.
