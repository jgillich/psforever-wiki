**Sunderer**

The **Sunderer** is a large, lumbering heavy ground transport capable of
carrying a driver, 2 gunners, 6 passengers, and 2
[MAXs](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md). The gunners man two large 75mm
Tank Cannons to be used in defense against vehicles, but depend on squad members
disembarking to protect against up close infantry attack.
