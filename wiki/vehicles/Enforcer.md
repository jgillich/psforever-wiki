**Enforcer**

The [New Conglomerate](../factions/New_Conglomerate.md) **Enforcer** buggy is
obtained with the 3 point
[Assault Buggy](<../certifications/Assault_Buggy_(Certification).md>)
[Certification](../certifications/Certification.md) or the 5 point
[Light Scout](../certifications/Light_Scout.md) certification.

This vehicle requires one driver and one gunner to operate its
[Firebird](../weapons/Firebird.md) rocket system. The Firebird rocket does
significant damage to vehicles and infantry alike, and is a direct-firing
projectile.

The open cockpit of this vehicle allows the driver to wear
[Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) or less.
