**Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT)**

The **Advanced Nanite Transport (ANT)** is used to resupply
[facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) with [NTUs](../items/NTU.md).

To do so, the driver must first drive into a
[Warpgate](../locations/Warpgate.md) or [Geowarp](../locations/Geowarp.md)
bubble and deploy the **ANT**. (Default key mapping is 'B'.) Note: If harvesting
from a [Geowarp](../locations/Geowarp.md), that Geowarp must be active at the
time.

When the **ANT's** capacitors are full, it will automatically undeploy. The
driver must travel to a facility and deploy the **ANT** near the
[NTU Silo](../locations/NTU_Silo.md). The **ANT** will undeploy automatically
when the [NTU Silo](../locations/NTU_Silo.md) is full or the **ANT's**
capacitors are empty.

One fully-filled **ANT** carries approximately 150% of one
[facility](../locations/Facilities.md)'s total [NTU](../items/NTU.md) capacity.

Caution: Fully-charged **ANTs** have a significant secondary blast radius when
destroyed.
