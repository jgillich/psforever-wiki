**Aurora**

The Aurora variant developed by the [Vanu
Sovereignty](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) is equipped with [Flux
Pod](../items/Flux_Pod.md) Launchers, similar in effect to the [Flux
Cannon](../weapons/Flux_Cannon.md) with an indirect arc of fire. A
secondary fire mode launches a salvo of 6-pods in rapid succession with
a large [cone of fire](cone_of_fire.md) that rains destruction
on the enemy. Each clip holds 12 pods, thus one must reload often. Best
used against infantry, but effective against other
[vehicles](Vehicle.md)/armor at close range. Due to the arc of
fire, we suggest you avoid upclose encounters. Like the
[Deliverer](Deliverer.md), the Aurora has adequate
[trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) space and can cross calm rivers and waterways
by floating at the surface.

**Introduced: May 27, 2004 with update version
