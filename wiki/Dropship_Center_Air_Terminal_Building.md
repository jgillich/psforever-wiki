As the name says, this Air Terminal Building can only be found in the
[Courtyard](Courtyard.md "wikilink") of a [Dropship
Center](Dropship_Center.md "wikilink").

This Building features a Dropship Air Terminal, the only Terminal where
you can acquire a [Lodestar](Lodestar.md "wikilink"),
[Galaxy](Galaxy.md "wikilink"), or [Galaxy
Gunship](Galaxy_Gunship.md "wikilink"), and a [Matrix
Panel](Matrix_Panel.md "wikilink"). The building has two doors, one leading
to the Creation Pad and one leading to the Courtyard.

If the Dropship Center is a [LLU](LLU.md "wikilink")
[Facility](Facility.md "wikilink") the [Lattice Logic Unit
Socket](Lattice_Logic_Unit_Socket.md "wikilink") will also be in this
Building.
