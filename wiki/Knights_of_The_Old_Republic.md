## Knights of the Old Republic

Knights of the Old Republic is an [outfit](outfit "wikilink") led by
founders TRxTopDawg and TRxMadDawgx that fights for the [Terran
Republic](Terran_Republic "wikilink") on the
[Emerald](Emerald "wikilink") [Planetside](Planetside "wikilink")
server.

They specialize in Heavy Infantry and Fast Response. Also known as KOTOR
or TRx.

They focus on teamwork and brotherhood, this causing their motto to be
"Win Together Die Together." When a new member desires to join KOTOR,
they must first start a completely new character. In this way, they have
developed and grown with the outfit, having built their character and
developed their gameplay to match that of the outfit's principles and
ideals.

They hold themselves to a high standard of gameplay, not allowing their
own members to do such hated and despciable acts as Spawn Camping,
uncalled for Team Killing, even going so far as to disallow any member
to be certified in any form of BFR certification.

Officers of KOTOR: TRxTopDawg, TRxMadDawgx, TRxSmokin, TRxReindeer, and
TRxShade.

Also TRxMadDawg has the sexiest voice, he makes me want to turn a bit
fruity if ya get me.
