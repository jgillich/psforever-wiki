OUTCASTERS is the largest Werner TR outfit and one of the most
established Outfits in Planetside.

Originaly formed by Outcast and Reload and now lead by The Council of
Five - a group of highly experienced players dedicated to the outfit.
With a talented team of battle hardened Senior Officers we are able to
run multiple squads and Platoons in fast and furious action to crush and
defeat our enemies.

We are always looking for new recruits and the best squad leaders are
always quickly promoted as we aim to be the best outfit out there.

Current council members are: AndyW Mimi Hillfort MISteve NookiEPoring

Send any of us a tell in-game for an invite to the outfit.

Outcasters have made a name for themselves as an outfit that is large
enough to accomodate both easy going players and more tactically minded
individuals. We run regular events including the famous 'Elite Squad' -
aimed at highly tactical and organised assaults on key facilities to
sever links and provide support to the main TR zerg.

Our Motto is "As One!".
