**BFR Imprinting** is the process by which a soldier acquires
[BFR](BFR.md "wikilink") certification.

The imprint is used to tune the [Resonance
Crystals](Resonance_Crystals.md "wikilink") implanted in all soldier to the
thought-patterns of that particular soldier so as to allow the soldier
to control the systems of a BFR.

The process includes achieving 5 [Cavern
Captures](Cavern_Captures.md "wikilink") and getting 75 [unique
kills](Unique_kill.md "wikilink") inside the caverns. Kills on enemies in
[vehicles](vehicle.md "wikilink") or [Ancient Sentry
Turrets](Ancient_Sentry_Turret.md "wikilink") do not count toward the kill
requirement. After the capture and kill requirements, you must step into
the core beam at the [Core Complex](Core_Complex.md "wikilink") in one of
the caves to complete the imprinting process. Characters created before
June 18, 2009 are automatically imprinted and do not have to go through
this process (see: [6th Anniversary
Update](6th_Anniversary_Update.md "wikilink")).
