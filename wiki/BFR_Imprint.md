**BFR Imprinting** is the process by which a soldier acquires
[BFR](/BFR "wikilink") certification.

The imprint is used to tune the [Resonance
Crystals](/Resonance_Crystals "wikilink") implanted in all soldier to the
thought-patterns of that particular soldier so as to allow the soldier
to control the systems of a BFR.

The process includes achieving 5 [Cavern
Captures](/Cavern_Captures "wikilink") and getting 75 [unique
kills](/Unique_kill "wikilink") inside the caverns. Kills on enemies in
[vehicles](/vehicle "wikilink") or [Ancient Sentry
Turrets](/Ancient_Sentry_Turret "wikilink") do not count toward the kill
requirement. After the capture and kill requirements, you must step into
the core beam at the [Core Complex](/Core_Complex "wikilink") in one of
the caves to complete the imprinting process. Characters created before
June 18, 2009 are automatically imprinted and do not have to go through
this process (see: [6th Anniversary
Update](/6th_Anniversary_Update "wikilink")).
