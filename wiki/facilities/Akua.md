Akua is one of the best defensive [facility](../locations/Facilities.md)
_locations_ in the game, due to its high altitude and the surrounding geography.
The mountains east of Akua are so tall and steep as to be completely impassible
by anything (air or ground vehicles or ground troops). There is a sheer cliff
dropoff (the crater, or caldera, wall) to Akua's west.

Enemy air vehicles are limited to about a 290 degree sector of attack, versus
the typical 360 degrees, and can only come in low due to altitude restrictions.
Plus, the surrounding terrain is excellent for anti-aircraft defense.

Ground forces can only approach Akua via two roads - one to the north, the other
to the south. Both are long, uphill approaches and both are narrow canyons,
making them ideal for mine-laying and defense in-general.

There is also no [tower](../locations/Towers.md) adjacent to Akua, and the
difficult ground approach and lack of hiding places make it hard to get an AMS
close to the base.
