Amun is a [Sub-Capitol](../locations/Sub-Capitol.md) and [Technology
Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md) on southern
[Solsar](../locations/Solsar.md). Nearby are a [Watch
tower](../locations/Watch_tower.md), 235m to the south, and [Bio
Laboratory](../locations/Bio_Laboratory.md) [Horus](../locations/Horus.md),
approximately 400m to the west.

The front door faces north, and there is a [pillbox](../locations/Pillbox.md)
outside the southern gate, facing the [Watch
tower](../locations/Watch_tower.md).

There are hills to the west, east, and south that provide good sniping
points. Any flat terrain near the base is filled with trees and rocks,
practically forcing [vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) to stay on the road.
