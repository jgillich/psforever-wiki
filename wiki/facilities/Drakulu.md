# Drakulu

The front door faces east, towards the Gun Tower. The nearby Southeast
[Courtyard](../locations/Courtyard.md) gate features a single
[Pillbox](../locations/Pillbox.md) facing South.

The terrain around Drakulu features dramatic elevations; to the North is a steep
cliff which provides a strategic vantage on the
[courtyard](../locations/Courtyard.md) for attackers. Significant hills extend
both West and East from the [SOI](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md). To the
South is a moderately steep but not impassable descent to [Rehua](Rehua.md).
This sloping area is heavily featured with small hills, valleys, boulders, and
trees.
