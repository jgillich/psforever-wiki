# Atar

Atar is a [Dropship Center](../locations/Dropship_Center.md) and the only
Facility on [Nexus](../locations/Oshur.md#Nexus). It is in the center of Nexus,
in grids J10 and J11.

It has [Lattice](../terminology/Lattice.md) links to:

- An always-inactive [Geowarp](../locations/Geowarp.md)
- [Ascension](../locations/Oshur.md#Acsension)
- [Extinction](../locations/Oshur.md#Extinction)

It has 3 Towers that are close to the base, of which the Gun Tower to the South
the closest is.

Atar is a Hack-and-Hold Facility.

Atar is very defensible by the simple virtue of its being the sole facility on
the island. Vehicles can only be obtained elsewhere and brought in through a
[Warpgate](../locations/Warpgate.md) - a tedious and time-consuming endevour for
a protracted battle. Defenders also have the advantage of the bottlenecks
created by the design of dropship center hallways.
