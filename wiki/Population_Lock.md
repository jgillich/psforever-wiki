A population lock is when a [continent](continent.md "wikilink") is full,
and cannot hold any more players.

They come in two varieties:

- Empire Population Lock - The maximum numbers of troops for your
  specific [empire](empire.md "wikilink") has been reached for this
  continent. However, the same may not be true for the other empire at
  the time.

<!-- -->

- Population Lock - Also referred to as a "hard lock." This is when
  the continent cannot fit any more troops from any and all empires.
  This lock is put in place due to hardware limitations on the
  continental servers, and is only seen during a very intense
  three-way battle.
