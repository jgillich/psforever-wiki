The [Knights of Sovereignty](http://www.knightsofsovereignty.org) are
one of the largest and highest points scoring
[Outfits](Outfit.md) on [VS](Vanu_Sovereignty.md)
[Emerald](Emerald.md).

Our primary objective is to have FUN playing
[Planetside](PlanetSide.md), whilst remembering that Real Life
always comes first. The outfit atmosphere is friendly and mature.
Problems of any sort are rare.

We don't have any requirements for joining the outfit, but we do
encourage the use of [TeamSpeak](TeamSpeak.md), and have a fast
response squad for those people who want to be involved in a more
organised aspect of the outfit. Weekly outfit nights now come as
standard.

KoS has something for both experienced and new players. [Please visit
our website](http://www.knightsofsovereignty.org) or send any member a
/tell in game.
