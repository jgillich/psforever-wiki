The **Regeneration** [implant](implant.md) allows a soldier to
heal 1 point of [Health](Health.md) at the expense of 2 points
of [Stamina](Stamina.md) per second. Once activated, the implant
continues to function until either all Health is restored, Stamina runs
out, or it is switched off. Using Regeneration will **not** restart the
hacking sequence if used while hacking (unlike
[MedKits](MedKit.md) or someone healing you using the [Medical
Applicator](Medical_Applicator.md)).

Regeneration is represented on the [HUD](Heads-up_Display.md) as a
heart-shaped icon.
