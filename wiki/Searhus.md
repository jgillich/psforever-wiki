## Description

This world rages with storms. The moments when the weather is clear are
momentous as the volcanism that erupts around the world feeds belt after
belt of the fiercest storms imaginable. The
[continent](continent.md) of **Searhus** seems sheltered in the
center of a stable "eye" in the storms, but even the peripheral storms
felt here are severe by comparison elsewhere.

The center of this continent is a gigantic volcanic caldera. The bases
inside that crater are an obvious stronghold on the continent, but to
keep those bases secure, the facilities on the rim of the caldera should
be secured as well. Beware the lava pools! They are extremely
unforgiving.
