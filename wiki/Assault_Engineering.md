**Assault Engineering**

The new [Assault Engineering](Assault_Engineering "wikilink") is
designed for offense, opposed to it's defensive counterpart
[Fortification Engineering](Fortification_Engineering "wikilink"). It
has Deployables and Abilities that give Friendly troops protection in
the field, as well as more fire power.

## Field Deployment Unit (FDU)

This larger version of the Adaptive Construction Engine (ACE) is used to
create the [Aegis Shield Generator](Aegis_Shield_Generator "wikilink")
as well as the [One-Manned Field
Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret "wikilink"). It takes up the same size
as the biggest Rifles do in your inventory. See [Field Deployment
Unit](Field_Deployment_Unit "wikilink") for more information.

## Aegis Shield Generator

The Aegis Shield Generator provides an area for Friendly troops to
safely repair/heal themselves, take cover or refill their ammunition, if
upgraded. For more information see [Aegis Shield
Generator](Aegis_Shield_Generator "wikilink").

## One-Manned Field Turret (OMFT)

The One-Manned Field Turret, or OMFT for short, has it's own variant for
all three [Empires](Empire "wikilink"). The [New
Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate "wikilink") gets the
[Osprey](Osprey "wikilink"), the [Terran
Republic](Terran_Republic "wikilink") has the
[Avenger](Avenger "wikilink") and the [Vanu
Sovereignty](Vanu_Sovereignty "wikilink") has the
[Orion](Orion "wikilink"). These Turrets are designed to supress the
Enemy in the Field, and have [weaponry](weapon "wikilink") similar to
their Anti-Infantry [MAX](MAX "wikilink") Units. For more information
see [One-Manned Field Turret](One-Manned_Field_Turret "wikilink"),
[Osprey](Osprey "wikilink"), [Avenger](Avenger "wikilink") or
[Orion](Orion "wikilink").

## Disruptor Mine

Similar to the [High Explosive Mine](ACE#High_Explosive_Mine "wikilink")
it detonates when Enemies in range. However, instead of exploding, they
emit a small EMP burst, with affects similar to that of a [Jammer
Grenade](Jammer_Grenade "wikilink") or a Commanders EMP. For more
information see [Disruptor Mine](Disruptor_Mine "wikilink").

## Ability to place Spitfire Turrets inside Enemy SOIs

Assault Engineers have the special ability to place Spitfire Turrets
inside the SOI of Enemy Facilities and Towers. If used smart, it can
keep Enemies locked inside, and allowing Friendliess to push into the
[courtyard](courtyard "wikilink") or even the Facility or Tower itself.

## Ammunition Upgrade for the Aegis Shield Generator

Assault Engineers can Upgrade Aegis Shield Generators with an Ammunition
Supply, allowing friendly Infantry and [MAX](MAX "wikilink") Units to
get ammo. Note that vehicle ammunition and support equipment cannot be
obtained. Upgrading works by use of the [Nano
Dispenser](Nano_Dispenser "wikilink") with regular canisters.

## Increased Repair Efficiency

Assault Engineers use [Armor Canisters](Armor_Canister "wikilink") more
efficiently, resulting in increased repair efficiency for
[MAXes](MAX "wikilink") (1.5x, from 12 to 18), equipment, and
[vehicles](vehicles "wikilink") (2x, from 32 to 64) over that of a
standard engineer.
