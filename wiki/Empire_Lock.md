An Empire Lock is when all available slots for a given
[Empire](/Empire "wikilink") on a specific [Planet](/Planet "wikilink")
are in use.

Each Empire is currently allowed roughly 133 troops per continent, or 13
full [squads](/squad "wikilink").

Empire Lock status can be viewed from the [Interstellar
Map](/Interstellar_Map "wikilink") as a padlock symbol on one of the side
windows.
