An Empire Lock is when all available slots for a given
[Empire](Empire.md "wikilink") on a specific [Planet](Planet.md "wikilink")
are in use.

Each Empire is currently allowed roughly 133 troops per continent, or 13
full [squads](squad.md "wikilink").

Empire Lock status can be viewed from the [Interstellar
Map](Interstellar_Map.md "wikilink") as a padlock symbol on one of the side
windows.
