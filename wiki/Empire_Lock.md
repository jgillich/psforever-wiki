An Empire Lock is when all available slots for a given
[Empire](Empire.md) on a specific [Planet](Planet.md)
are in use.

Each Empire is currently allowed roughly 133 troops per continent, or 13
full [squads](squad.md).

Empire Lock status can be viewed from the [Interstellar
Map](Interstellar_Map.md) as a padlock symbol on one of the side
windows.
