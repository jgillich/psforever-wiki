## Description

The name [Oshur](Oshur.md) was once associated with an extremely
rough desert continent consisting of the broken bones of an impact
crater. The rough badlands and choppy terrain made it relatively easy to
hide fairly large forces in what seemed to be plain view. A giant,
unexplained avian skeleton once lay fossilized on the continent, giving
rise to lively discussions about the Vanu that were here before.

But a year ago, the event we know as [The
Bending](The_Bending.md) occurred, ripping apart our reality and
spreading the Auraxian continents across a dozen worlds. Oshur was
erased or torn asunder, and in its place appeared 4 smaller landmasses
we came to call [Battle Islands](Battle_Islands.md)

The Battle Islands have unique vehicle and weapon limitations. [Heavy
Assault](Heavy_Assault.md) weaponry can not be purchased or used
on any of the islands. [BFRs](BFR.md) and most [Technology
Plant](Technology_Plant.md) vehicles can not be purchased or
used. The exceptions are the [Wasp](Wasp.md),
[Phantasm](Phantasm.md), and [Skyguard](Skyguard.md),
which can be purchased on [Desolation](Desolation.md) and used
on any Battle Island. The [Thunderer](Thunderer.md),
[Aurora](Aurora.md), [Raider](Raider.md), [Galaxy
Gunship](Galaxy_Gunship.md), and [Flail](Flail.md) are
also prohibited.

This collection of Battle Islands is sometimes refered to as
[BI](Acronyms_and_Slang.md).
