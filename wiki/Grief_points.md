**Grief points** are a mechanism introduced in an attempt to control the
amount of [friendly fire](friendly_fire.md) that takes place in
PlanetSide. If at any point a character damages soldiers or equipment
owned by their own [Empire](Empire.md) (with a weapon or a
vehicle), they will be awarded grief points corresponding to the amount
of damage caused. As grief points accumulate the subsequent grief added
is significantly higher. This is to prevent unduly penalizing actual
accidents. The Grief levels can be seen below:

If grief accumulates past 1000 points (level 3), characters will be
penalized in several ways, such as being unable to fire weapons and
reducing the top speed of all vehicles (so you cannot damage friendlies
by running into them). The duration of the penalty is directly related
to how much damage you did. The penalties will continue for each
subsequent grief point earned past 1000, and will only stop when your
grief points fall below 1000. You can be banned for grief points in
excess of 5000. Grief points will gradually dissipate over time (1 point
every 10 minutes). Note: while your grief points will dissipate even
while not logged into PlanetSide, the grief lock timer does not. Thus if
you have a 30 minute grief lock, you must stay logged in for it to
expire, or else the lock time will carry over until your next session.

[Squad](Squad.md) and [outfit](Outfit.md) members are
exempt from grief for damaging fellow members, as it is assumed that the
squad and outfit can manage itself.

You can check your Grief point total on the Character pane. Grief points
are shared among characters on the same server, preventing griefers from
logging in with one character, racking up grief points, and switching
characters to have a clean slate.

Two common sources of grief are the [Thumper](Thumper.md) and
the [Liberator](Liberator.md). The Thumper because in
inexperienced hands it can cause a large amount of area-effect damage to
friendlies (especially in confined base corridors), and the Liberator
because of the delay between the release of a bomb and the subsequent
detonation at ground level.
