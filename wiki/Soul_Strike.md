![](images/Decoys_memorial1.jpg "fig:Decoys_memorial1.jpg") Soul_Strike is a
mid-sized [outfit](outfit.md) that fights for the [Vanu
Sovereignty](Vanu_Sovereignty.md) on the
[Emerald](Emerald.md) [Server](Server.md). They also
have alt chapters on [New
Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate.md)-[Markov](Markov.md)
and [Terran
Republic](Terran_Republic.md)-[Werner](Werner.md).

## Outfit History

In the summer of 2004 a couple of Soldiers deployed in Korea joined
[Planetside](PlanetSide.md). They quickly were snatched up by a
Tactical Outfit, the Band of Bros. Both Soldiers excelled in the game,
and in making leadership decisions, leading to their quick promotion to
officer rank. One of those Soldiers excelled so much that the outfit
leader, one NemisisOrion, Gave the outfit to him when he left the game.
That Soldier was Soulkeeper. Since most of the experienced players left
with NemisisOrion, Soulkeeper had to build the outfit back up. After a
couple of months of hard work doing that rebuild, NemisisOrion came
back, and wanted control of the outfit again, which Soulkeeper
relinquished peacefully. NemisisOrion used a diffrent leadership style
than Soulkeeper, which many new members of the outfit who had never
served under NemisisOrion did not like at all. They convinced Soulkeeper
to drop from Band of Bros and lead them in a new Outfit, named
Soul_Strike. At first there was some bad blood between the newer and
older Outfits, but over the years things have smoothed out. Soul_Strike
has also gone through periods of turmoil, usually when the Outfit Leader
must be gone for extended periods of time. As of December 2006, the
Outfit is just coming out of such a recession.

## Mission

Soul_Strike bills itself as a QRF (Quick Reaction Force). As such, it
trains its leaders to look for time critical missions. Due to its highly
mobile nature, the Outfit favors [Galaxy](vehicles/Galaxy.md) drops, and
[MBT](Medium_Battle_Tank.md) columns, among other tactics.
Soul_Strike also makes extensive use of voice chat as a force
multiplier.

## Leadership

Soul_Strike is lead as it always has been by its founder, Soulkeeper.
Underneath him are the commanding officers, and underneath them are
Tactical commanders. Anyone can take charge in a Soul_Strike Outfit
[squad](squad.md) or [platoon](platoon.md), and it is
encouraged that everyone in the Outfit get some leadership training. To
prevent leadership clashes, only one player is actively in command, and
if not the ranking officer online, his/her decisions are passed through
the ranking officer before being passed on to the troops.
