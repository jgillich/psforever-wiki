[facilities](/facilities "wikilink"), [towers](/towers "wikilink"), or the
Sanctuary [Respawn Buildings](/Respawn_Building "wikilink") where the
[Respawn tubes](/Respawn_tube "wikilink") are located.

## Surface Spawn Rooms

In addition to the spawn tubes, these rooms come equipped with
several[lockers](/lockers "wikilink") and 3 [Equipment
terminals](/Equipment_terminal "wikilink").

Respawn rooms are protected by low-energy [Pain
Fields](/Pain_Field "wikilink"). If a [Pain
Module](/Pain_Module "wikilink") is installed, this pain field is even
more lethal.

The Respawn room is adjacent to the [lounge](/lounge "wikilink") and
above the [barracks](/barracks "wikilink"). These three areas together
are sometimes refered to as the Barracks as well.

## Cavern Spawn Rooms

Cavern Spawn Rooms work exactly like the surface ones, meaning that when
you die, you can select where to spawn, and you will spawn there when
the timer is done.

However, the Cave Spawn Rooms have no [Spawn
Tubes](/Spawn_Tube "wikilink"), and can therefor not be destroyed. The
[Ancient Equipment Terminals](/Ancient_Equipment_Terminal "wikilink") in
the Spawn Rooms are also indestructable, making it harder to defend a
[Cavern](/Cavern "wikilink") [Facility](/Facility "wikilink") because you
cannot prevent the Enemy from respawning and getting their gear. Cavern
Spawn Rooms have a [Pain Field](/Pain_Field "wikilink") strength equal to
that of a [Pain Module](/Pain_Module "wikilink") by default.
