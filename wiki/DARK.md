**DARK** is an [Outfit](/Outfit "wikilink") comprised of mostly older
players who enjoy teamwork and playing in a mature fashion, but still
like to have fun. We have some excellent cloakers and are experienced
cave fighters, but **DARK** has no required focus or certs to join.
Prime playing time is 8 pm to 11 pm EST, but with members in multiple
timezones, we have people on much of the time. **DARK** has periodic
theme outfit nights as well as scheduled joint operations with
[Celestial Fire](/Celestial_Fire "wikilink").

**DARK**'s current Outfit leader is Malign, and our website is at
<http://www.darkhq.com>.
