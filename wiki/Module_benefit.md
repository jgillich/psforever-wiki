Installed [modules](/modules "wikilink") provide base benefits that can
be linked to other [facilities](/facilities "wikilink") via the
Continental [Lattice](/Lattice "wikilink"). A facility can enjoy many
module benefits from mulitiple bases through direct and indirect chains
of links.

Module benefits can be interupted if the base is
[hacked](/Capturing_Bases "wikilink") by the enemy, if the
[generator](/generator "wikilink") is destroyed, or the base runs out of
[NTU](/NTU "wikilink") and goes [neutral](/neutral "wikilink"). Any
facility linked to this incapacitated base, directly or via a chain of
bases, will lose that base's module benefit.

This system is a similar one used for [Facility Linked
Benefits](/Facility_Linked_Benefit "wikilink").

A yellow icon will appear above each base on the continental map that
hosts a module benefit.

[Cavern Locked](/Cavern_Lock "wikilink") benefits will also link the
lattice like the module benefit. The module icon will appear green over
the base with such a link.
