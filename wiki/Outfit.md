A player created and organized group of at least 2 players within the
same [Empire](Empire.md "wikilink"). Often times Outfits are specialized in
one area. (i.e. Aerial Combat, Sabotage, etc.) Outfits have the ability
to earn [Outfit Points](Outfit_Points.md "wikilink"). Once an Outfit has
attained 10.000 Outfit Points it may attain an Outfit Decal for use on
[vehicles](vehicle.md "wikilink") and armor owned by it's members. Outfit
