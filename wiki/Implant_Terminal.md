![](/images/PSScreenShot0282.jpg "fig:PSScreenShot0282.jpg") The Implant
Terminal inserts cybernetic devices called
[Implants](/Implants "wikilink") into various points, or slots, of a
soldier's body.

These devices enhance a soldier's abilities such as speed, senses,
stealth, healing, or data analysis depending on the implant chosen. The
terminal is able to install up to three such devices in a trooper based
upon [Battle Rank](/Battle_Rank "wikilink").

Implant Terminals are located in the [HART
buildings](/HART_building "wikilink") in each
[Empire](/Empire "wikilink")'s [Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink") and in
[Bio Laboratories](/Bio_Laboratory "wikilink") only.

These terminals are destroyable. The only reliable way to destroy one is
to put two boomers near the top of the terminal on the side. Other
weapons will have a very hard time damaging the terminal as the hitbox
is so small.

Note: To hack an Implant Terminal using the
[Hacking](<Hacking_(Certification)> "wikilink")
[Certification](/Certification "wikilink"), stand at the front of the
terminal and point your [REK](/REK "wikilink") near the top of the device
to start hacking.
