![](images/PSScreenShot0282.jpg "fig:PSScreenShot0282.jpg") The Implant
Terminal inserts cybernetic devices called
[Implants](Implants.md "wikilink") into various points, or slots, of a
soldier's body.

These devices enhance a soldier's abilities such as speed, senses,
stealth, healing, or data analysis depending on the implant chosen. The
terminal is able to install up to three such devices in a trooper based
upon [Battle Rank](Battle_Rank.md "wikilink").

Implant Terminals are located in the [HART
buildings](HART_building.md "wikilink") in each
[Empire](Empire.md "wikilink")'s [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink") and in
[Bio Laboratories](Bio_Laboratory.md "wikilink") only.

These terminals are destroyable. The only reliable way to destroy one is
to put two boomers near the top of the terminal on the side. Other
weapons will have a very hard time damaging the terminal as the hitbox
is so small.

Note: To hack an Implant Terminal using the
[Hacking](<Hacking_(Certification)> "wikilink")
[Certification](Certification.md "wikilink"), stand at the front of the
terminal and point your [REK](REK.md "wikilink") near the top of the device
to start hacking.
