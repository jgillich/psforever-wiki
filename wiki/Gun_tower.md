![](/images/Gun.jpg "fig:Gun.jpg") In addition to the standard features found in
all [Towers](/Towers "wikilink"), the Gun Tower is equipped with two
[Phalanx](/Phalanx "wikilink") Wall Turrets on the roof walkway, greatly
increasing their tactical value, and providing reasonably robust defence
against Infantry or Vehicular assault.

(Note: While a [Facility](/Facility "wikilink") expends
[NTU](/NTU "wikilink") to auto-repair Wall Turrets, a Gun Tower is
considered to have infinite NTU for this purpose, although the rate is
still very slow.)
