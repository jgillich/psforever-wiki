The [Platoon Leader](Platoon_Leader.md "wikilink") is the [Squad
Leader](Squad_Leader.md "wikilink") who invited the other two Squad Leaders
to merge their [squads](squad.md "wikilink") with his to form a
[Platoon](Platoon.md "wikilink"). Typically, in a default interface, the
[Platoon Leaders](Platoon_Leader.md "wikilink") squad will be the first
uppermost squad, followed by the first invited squad (or first to accept
the invite) in the middle and most recently joined at the bottom.
