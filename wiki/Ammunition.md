There are two main types of ammunition in
[Planetside](Planetside.md "wikilink"): Hand-held and
[Vehicle](Vehicle.md "wikilink").

Hand-held ammunition is stored in your character's
[inventory](inventory.md "wikilink") and supplied to the appropriate weapon
automatically. Some weapons can use multiple types of ammunition (like
[Armor Piercing](Armor_Piercing.md "wikilink") and standard rounds).

Vehicle ammunition is normally stored in the [trunk](trunk.md "wikilink")
of the vehicle and supplied to the appropriate weapon automatically. The
[Flail](Flail.md "wikilink") and [Switchblade](Switchblade.md "wikilink") are
the exceptions, using on-board capacitors for ammunition that can only
be refiled by an [Vehicle Energy
Crystal](Vehicle_Energy_Crystal.md "wikilink") or [Vehicle
Module](Vehicle_Module.md "wikilink") [benefit](Module_benefit.md "wikilink").

All ammunition native to your [empire](empire.md "wikilink") can be
obtained from any [Equipment Terminal](Equipment_Terminal.md "wikilink").
Vehicle ammunition is availible from the vehicle tab and can be manually
loaded into a vehicle's trunk. [Repair/Rearm.md
Silos](Repair/Rearm_Silo.md "wikilink") and [Landing
Pads](Landing_Pad.md "wikilink") distribute vehicle ammunition while you
are inside a vehicle.

Ammunition boxes come in sizes of 3x3, 4x4, and 5x5 depending on the
weapon. When obtaining hand-held ammunition, you can find the
appropriate ammo box next to the icon of the weapon you wish to use
under the "Weapons" tab. For vehicle ammunition, the lower pane of the
window lists what vehicle(s) the ammunition can be used in.
