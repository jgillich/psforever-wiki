Binding stores a player's DNA data into the [respawn
tubes](/respawn_tube "wikilink") of the selected
[facility](/facilities "wikilink") or [AMS](/AMS "wikilink").

To bind to a location, you must access a [Matrix
Panel](/Matrix_Panel "wikilink") and press the "G" key when prompted.

This creates a [spawn point](/spawn_point "wikilink") for the player to
respawn to from any location in the galaxy. Manually bound spawn points
are available in addition to the normal 'nearest' spawn points. A player
may bind to one [facility](/facilities "wikilink") and one
[AMS](/AMS "wikilink") at a time, meaning that if a player plans his
spawn points correctly, he or she can have up to 6 spawn points to chose
from (2 [AMSes](/AMS "wikilink"), 2 [bases](/facilities "wikilink"), a
[tower](/tower "wikilink"), and the [sanctuary](/sanctuary "wikilink")).

Pressing the "G" key again at the Matrix Panel of a bound location will
erase the DNA data and the bind.
