Binding stores a player's DNA data into the [respawn
tubes](respawn_tube.md) of the selected
[facility](facilities.md) or [AMS](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md).

To bind to a location, you must access a [Matrix
Panel](Matrix_Panel.md) and press the "G" key when prompted.

This creates a [spawn point](spawn_point.md) for the player to
respawn to from any location in the galaxy. Manually bound spawn points
are available in addition to the normal 'nearest' spawn points. A player
may bind to one [facility](facilities.md) and one
[AMS](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) at a time, meaning that if a player plans his
spawn points correctly, he or she can have up to 6 spawn points to chose
from (2 [AMSes](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md), 2 [bases](facilities.md), a
[tower](tower.md), and the [sanctuary](sanctuary.md)).

Pressing the "G" key again at the Matrix Panel of a bound location will
erase the DNA data and the bind.
