for the Empire Specific tanks available through the [Armored Assault
II](Armored_Assault_II.md "wikilink") Certification.

Also known as **MBT's**, these vehicles all require a separate driver
and gunner, have around 3500-4500 points of armor and are generally
designed to counter other vehcular threats in an attempt to dominate
outdoor battlefield areas, although specific capabilities vary:

- [Terran Republic](Terran_Republic.md "wikilink")
  [Prowler](Prowler.md "wikilink"): Two Gunners, Independent AI/AA
  Chaingun, High RoF, Steep Shell Arc

<!-- -->

- [Vanu Sovereignty](Vanu_Sovereignty.md "wikilink")
  [Magrider](Magrider.md "wikilink"): Driver AI Gun, Amphibious, Strafe,
  No Main Gun Arc

<!-- -->

- [New Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate.md "wikilink")
  [Vanguard](Vanguard.md "wikilink"): Large Main Gun (150mm), Low
  Profile, Gunner AI/AA Secondary Mode, Low Shell Arc, Largest Armor

All three vehicles can generally shrug off AI weapon fire, and are only
really threatened by concentrated Anti-Vehicular weaponry from multiple
units, minefields, air strikes, or other armor. At full speed, all three
cause signficant damage to any infantry units when driven over (see:
[Transportation Citation](Transportation_Citation.md "wikilink"))

All Medium Battle Tanks are considered to be 'enclosed' for driver armor
purposes, and so may not be driven while wearing the [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md "wikilink").
