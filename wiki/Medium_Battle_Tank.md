[Vanguard](/Vanguard "wikilink") square off\]\] The collective group term
for the Empire Specific tanks available through the [Armored Assault
II](/Armored_Assault_II "wikilink") Certification.

Also known as **MBT's**, these vehicles all require a separate driver
and gunner, have around 3500-4500 points of armor and are generally
designed to counter other vehcular threats in an attempt to dominate
outdoor battlefield areas, although specific capabilities vary:

- [Terran Republic](/Terran_Republic "wikilink")
  [Prowler](/Prowler "wikilink"): Two Gunners, Independent AI/AA
  Chaingun, High RoF, Steep Shell Arc

<!-- -->

- [Vanu Sovereignty](/Vanu_Sovereignty "wikilink")
  [Magrider](/Magrider "wikilink"): Driver AI Gun, Amphibious, Strafe,
  No Main Gun Arc

<!-- -->

- [New Conglomerate](/New_Conglomerate "wikilink")
  [Vanguard](/Vanguard "wikilink"): Large Main Gun (150mm), Low
  Profile, Gunner AI/AA Secondary Mode, Low Shell Arc, Largest Armor

All three vehicles can generally shrug off AI weapon fire, and are only
really threatened by concentrated Anti-Vehicular weaponry from multiple
units, minefields, air strikes, or other armor. At full speed, all three
cause signficant damage to any infantry units when driven over (see:
[Transportation Citation](/Transportation_Citation "wikilink"))

All Medium Battle Tanks are considered to be 'enclosed' for driver armor
purposes, and so may not be driven while wearing the [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](/Reinforced_Exo-Suit "wikilink").
