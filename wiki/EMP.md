## EMP (ElectroMagnetic Pulse)

The EMP is a command ability that any soldier with [Command
Rank](Command_Rank.md) 3 or higher can access using their
[Command Uplink Device (or CUD)](Command_Uplink_Device.md), the
range depends on the users Command Rank however.

- Command Rank 3: 10 meter radius
- Command Rank 4: 15 meter radius
- Command Rank 5: 20 meter radius

An EMP can also be triggered by a charged [BFR](BattleFrame_Robotics.md) [NTU
Siphon](NTU_Siphon.md) and by the drivers of a
[Leviathan](Leviathan.md), [Juggernaut](Juggernaut.md),
or [Vindicator](Vindicator.md).

Once triggered, this ability detonates a blast that doesn't harm
soldiers, but detonates [Mines](#High_Explosive_Mine),
[Boomers](<#Remote-Detonated_Charge_(Boomer)>), and disables
[Spitfire Turrets](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Spitfire_Turret), [Shadow
Turrets](Shadow_Turret.md), [Cerberus
Turrets](Cerberus_Turret.md), [Wall
Turrets](Phalanx.md) and [Motion
Sensors](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Motion_Sensor_Alarm). It also disables all
[Implants](Implants.md) and [Proximity
Maps](Proximity_Map.md) of any enemy soldiers in the area, as
well as the weapons of all vehicles nearby, excluding
[BFRs](BattleFrame_Robotics.md), the Blast does damage the BFR systems however.

It is often utilized when clearing large fields of [Combat Engineering
(or CE)](Combat_Engineering.md) whenever a force is attacking a
base, or a small team is commencing an insertion into an enemy base at a
heavily CE-ed entrance.

The recharge time for an EMP is 20 minutes.
