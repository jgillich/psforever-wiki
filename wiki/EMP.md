## EMP (ElectroMagnetic Pulse)

The EMP is a command ability that any soldier with [Command
Rank](Command_Rank.md "wikilink") 3 or higher can access using their
[Command Uplink Device (or CUD)](Command_Uplink_Device.md "wikilink"), the
range depends on the users Command Rank however.

- Command Rank 3: 10 meter radius
- Command Rank 4: 15 meter radius
- Command Rank 5: 20 meter radius

An EMP can also be triggered by a charged [BFR](BFR.md "wikilink") [NTU
Siphon](NTU_Siphon.md "wikilink") and by the drivers of a
[Leviathan](Leviathan.md "wikilink"), [Juggernaut](Juggernaut.md "wikilink"),
or [Vindicator](Vindicator.md "wikilink").

Once triggered, this ability detonates a blast that doesn't harm
soldiers, but detonates [Mines](#High_Explosive_Mine "wikilink"),
[Boomers](<#Remote-Detonated_Charge_(Boomer)> "wikilink"), and disables
[Spitfire Turrets](ACE.md#Spitfire_Turret "wikilink"), [Shadow
Turrets](Shadow_Turret.md "wikilink"), [Cerberus
Turrets](Cerberus_Turret.md "wikilink"), [Wall
Turrets](Wall_Turret.md "wikilink") and [Motion
Sensors](ACE.md#Motion_Sensor_Alarm "wikilink"). It also disables all
[Implants](Implants.md "wikilink") and [Proximity
Maps](Proximity_Map.md "wikilink") of any enemy soldiers in the area, as
well as the weapons of all vehicles nearby, excluding
[BFRs](BFR.md "wikilink"), the Blast does damage the BFR systems however.

It is often utilized when clearing large fields of [Combat Engineering
(or CE)](Combat_Engineering.md "wikilink") whenever a force is attacking a
base, or a small team is commencing an insertion into an enemy base at a
heavily CE-ed entrance.

The recharge time for an EMP is 20 minutes.
