**Pounder**

The **Pounder** is the
[Anti-Vehicle MAX](<../certifications/Anti-Vehicle_MAX_(Certification).md>) of
the [Terran Republic](../factions/Terran_Republic.md). It boasts two large mortar
launchers on both its arms that can launch its ammunition over great ranges.
This is an indirect fire weapon, requiring the operator to compensate for
gravity, but making it possible to attack vehicles from behind a hill. The
"Anchor" ability locks the [MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) in
place and reduces its field of fire, but essentially doubles it rate of fire and
reduces the size of the [cone of fire](../terminology/Cone_of_fire.md) bloom.
The overdrive ability can also be used, increasing the rate of fire by 50% while
still enabling the pounder to move.

Shots to kill:
