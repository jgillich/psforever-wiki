**Standard Exo-Suit**

The **Standard Exo-Suit** is issued to every soldier at spawn time. While it
does allow the wearer to run a little faster than the
[Agile Exo-Suit](Agile_Exo-Suit.md), its smaller
[inventory](../terminology/Inventory.md), single
[pistol slot](../terminology/Holster.md), and the fact that Agile is also available
without other [Certifications](../certifications/Certifications.md) means this
armor has no practical use, other than quick defense of a base without power.
