## Terrain

Although bridge battles are common on this island, water-based attacks
are possible via hover ([AT](/Ancient_Tech "wikilink") or
[VS](/VS "wikilink") vehicles and [Deliverer](/Deliverer "wikilink")
variants. Shoreline access is possible at many strategic points on this
map if bridge battles are blocking progress elsewhere.

## Limitations

As is the case with all [Battle Islands](/Battle_Islands "wikilink"),
heavy weapons and vehicles do not operate here. Not permitted are [Heavy
Assault](/Heavy_Assault "wikilink") weapons,
[Reavers](/Reaver "wikilink"), [Artillery](/Artillery "wikilink"),
[BFRs](/BFR "wikilink"), [Medium Battle
Tanks](/Medium_Battle_Tank "wikilink"), and Empire Specific
[Deliverer](/Deliverer "wikilink") variants.

## Geology

Long ago, geological stresses erupted here, pushing up through the sea
floor and creating a volcano that spewed lava for a time before dying.
When a great quake rumbled through this area mere decades ago, a new
smaller volcano was born amidst the ruins of the old crater.

Now, laval islands have been cut by wind, water, and steady erosion. The
volcano is dormant for now, but who knows how long that will last.
