**Werner** was the European [PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md "wikilink") Server
and was located in Amsterdam, Holland. On August 25, 2009 the server was
merged with [Gemini](Gemini.md "wikilink"). The character and
[outfit](outfit.md "wikilink") renaming methods are the same as for the
[Markov](Markov.md "wikilink")/[Emerald](Emerald.md "wikilink") merge. See the
[Gemini](Gemini.md "wikilink") page for more information.
