[Speed](/Speed_Module "wikilink"), and [Equipment
Modules](/Equipment_Module "wikilink") in their cradles in an
[Interlink](/Interlink "wikilink") [Facility](/Facility "wikilink")\]\]
Modules are devices that can be obtained from the [Module
Buildings](/Module_Building "wikilink") in the
[Caverns](/Caverns "wikilink") introduced by the expansion [Core
Combat](/Core_Combat "wikilink").

When installed inside a surface base [facility](/facilities "wikilink"),
modules grant the facility and the controlling empire a [module
benefit](/module_benefit "wikilink") (apart from [Facility Linked
Benefits](/Facility_Linked_Benefit "wikilink")), depending on the type of
module installed.

In order to obtain a module, one must go to the caverns, capture a
[Module Building](/Module_Building "wikilink"), obtain a non-powered
module, and take it to the Core Complex to be charged. Once the module
is removed from the [Module Building](/Module_Building "wikilink"), the
player has fifteen minutes to charge the module and bring it to the
surface. Once on the surface, the player has an additional fifteen
minutes to install the module into a friendly base. Once the module is
placed in a [Module Cradle](/Module_Cradle "wikilink"), all bases linked
to the module will receive the benefits.

Each [Empire](/Empire "wikilink") has a limit of 10
[Modules](/Modules "wikilink") that they can have installed at any given
time. If exceeded, the only way to gain more modules is to steal them
from enemy bases that have them. Also, only three modules can be
in-transit in a cave at the same time. More modules cannot be taken from
their cradles until at least one is taken to the surface or the timer
expires on one. Taking a non-charged module to the surface causes the
module to disappear. If a charged Module is still in the cave when an
enemy empire captures the Module Building it was taken from, the module
will explode instantly, regardless of the timer.

Note: when carrying a module, your character will "flash" the color of
the module you picked up. Also, similar to the [LLU](/LLU "wikilink"), an
icon will appear on the map giving the location of you and the module
for both friendlies and enemies to see, thus it's best to have an escort
to avoid an enemy from stealing the module. A module icon flashing green
means a friendly has picked it up. A red flashing icon means an enemy
has it, and a black flashing icon means the module is on the ground. If
the fifteen minute timer expires on the module, it will start beeping a
different sound and explode after a random delay between 1 second and 5
minutes, killing the carrier and anything nearby.

## Available Modules

![](/images/Shield_module.jpg "fig:Shield_module.jpg")\]\] Currently, six types
of modules are available to be installed (map icon color is listed):

- [Equipment Module](/Equipment_Module "wikilink") (blue)
- [Health Module](/Health_Module "wikilink") (yellow)
- [Pain Module](/Pain_Module "wikilink") (beige)
- [Shield Module](/Shield_Module "wikilink") (aqua)
- [Speed Module](/Speed_Module "wikilink") (orange)
- [Vehicle Module](/Vehicle_Module "wikilink") (purple)

Empires may also try to achieve a [Cavern Lock](/Cavern_Lock "wikilink")
which will provide all six module benefits to any linked or chain linked
facility as if they had a module installed.

## Special Rules

The modules are unique constructs, and are subject to several special
rules, in the same vein as [LLUs](/LLU "wikilink").

1.  Once installed in a facility, they cannot be removed by friendlies
    under normal circumstances. This is to prevent
    [griefing](/Grief_points "wikilink"). However, friendlies can remove
    modules from their own base if the enemy has the facility under
    [hack](/hack "wikilink").
2.  Once installed at a facility, modules can only be stolen by enemies
    if one of two things happen.
    1.  If the [facility](/facility "wikilink")'s [Control
        Console](/Control_Console "wikilink") is
        [hacked](/Hack "wikilink").
    2.  If the facility's [generator](/generator "wikilink") is
        destroyed.
3.  If the facility where the module is installed reverts to a
    [neutral](/neutral "wikilink") state, the module is destroyed, as it
    has no power.
4.  Once installed at a facility, the module has a complete lifetime of
    roughly 28 hours, which is also the cavern rotation cycle's time
    period.
5.  The modules are extremely sensitive to changes in pressure. If a
    module is ever submerged in water, it will immediately detonate,
    destroying itself and anything near it.

<!-- -->

1.  The modules become unstable when they are taken out of their [Module
    Cradle](/Module_Cradle "wikilink"). They will explode if they are out
    of their cradle for more than 15 minutes.
