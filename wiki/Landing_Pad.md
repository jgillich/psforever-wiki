Repair/Rearm.md Landing Pad, commonly just refered to as a **Landing Pad**,
is a flat platform structure attached to the causewalks of every
[facility](Facilities.md), and to the roof of [Air
towers](Air_tower.md). The base versions have the capability to
(when it is linked to a friendly [Dropship
Center](Dropship_Center.md)) repair any air
[vehicle](Vehicle_Index.md) in the game. Landing Pads can rearm
air vehicles without the Dropship Center benefit.

Landing pads are the only structures that aircraft can land on and not
receive a deconstruction warning message.

Air Towers will both repair and rearm all air vehicles.
