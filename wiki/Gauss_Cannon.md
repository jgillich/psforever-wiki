The Gauss Cannon is the Primary Weapon of the [New
Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate.md "wikilink")
[Deliverer](Deliverer.md "wikilink") Variant the
[Thunderer](Thunderer.md "wikilink").

The Gauss Cannon has a relatively long Refire Rate, very small splash
damage, but deals a lot of damage on a direct hit. One direct hit will
kill a soldier wearing [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md "wikilink") armor. The Gauss Cannon fires
in a straight line, but the projectile speed is relatively slow. This
gives it a good chance against Ground [Vehicles](Vehicle.md "wikilink") and
Infantry, but rather low chance of hitting enemy aircraft that are
moving. With two of these weapons firing from a
[Thunderer](Thunderer.md "wikilink") on the same target, the Thunderer can
even challenge [Medium Battle Tanks](Medium_Battle_Tank.md "wikilink") and
have a good chance of winning.
