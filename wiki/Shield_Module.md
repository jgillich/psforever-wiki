[Facility](Facility.md) with a Shield Module Benefit\]\]
![](images/Shield_module.jpg "fig:Shield_module.jpg") Installing this
[Module](modules.md) provides the [Module
Benefit](module_benefit.md) of powering a Force Field across the
Gate, or openings in the [Courtyard](Courtyard.md) wall.

This Force Field stops ALL weapon fire. Most Vehicles cannot pass
through it and Enemy Infantry speed is slowed to Walk Speed while
passing through the Shield. The [Vindicator](Vindicator.md),
[Juggernaut](Juggernaut.md), and
[Leviathan](Leviathan.md) can pass through the shield with no
penalty.

Friendly Infantry and Vehicles can pass through the Force Field without
receiving Speed Penalties.

This module appears as aqua on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md).
