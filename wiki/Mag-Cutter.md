**Mag-Cutter**

Standard issue in all [Infiltration
Suits](Infiltration_Suit.md), [Standard
Exo-Suit](Standard_Exo-Suit.md), [Agile
Exo-Suit](Agile_Exo-Suit.md) and [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md), the Mag-Cutter is a generally
a weapon of last resort. (Default key: 5)

However, if a Soldier can manage to get close enough to use it, it does
do a considerable amount of damage, particularly in secondary mode, with
the aid of a [Melee Booster](Melee_Booster.md) implant.

Many Infiltrators use this weapon exclusively, as it requires no ammo,
and no holster space, only a steely nerve.

Secondary mode activates the powered magnetic edge of the blade,
doubling the damage per stab, but also creating a distinctive and
clearly audible noise as it does so.

(Note: This weapon is part of the soldier's armor and so cannot be
looted.)
