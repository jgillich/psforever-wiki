**Beamer**

The standard sidearm issued to all Vanu soldiers, the
[Beamer](Beamer.md) is the only sidearm with dual firing modes,
although the secondary armor-piercing setting is fairly useless due to
the relatively heavy protection of most armored targets.

The Beamer was the flagship of underpowered weaponry in Planetside for
almost a year, during which time soldiers lovingly nicknamed it
"Flashlight" due to its tendency to light a target up more than damage
it.

Since then, the Beamer has been powered up considerably, giving it a
respectable damage output coupled with a small cone of fire and low
bloom. The armor-piercing mode has a slightly bigger [Cone of
Fire](Cone_of_Fire.md) than the standard mode.

Shots to kill (Average on a close to medium range):
