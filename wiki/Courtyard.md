The **courtyard** is the area enclosed within a
[facility's](Facilities.md) walls. Stairwells at various points
along the walls allow access to the ramparts. Within the walls are
various support features such as the [NTU Silo](NTU_Silo.md),
[Repair/Rearm Silos](Repair_Rearm_Silo.md), and typically the
[BFR Shed](BFR_Shed.md) and [Vehicle
Terminal](Vehicle_Terminal.md). However, [Technology
Plants](Technology_Plant.md) have both Air and Ground [Vehicle
Terminals](Vehicle_Terminal.md) enclosed in the main structure.

The Courtyard has two arched entrances at opposite corners of the base,
allowing vehicular access. These entrances become sealed against most
enemy [vehicles](Vehicle.md) and gunfire with a lattice linked
[Shield Module](Shield_Module.md).
