**Nano Dispenser**

The [Nano Dispenser](/Nano_Dispenser "wikilink") (commonly referred to as
the _glue gun_ or _repair gun_) allows for field repair of all
"destroyable" equipment, i.e., [vehicles](/Vehicle "wikilink"), all
[turrets](/Turret "wikilink"), [equipment
terminals](/Equipment_Terminal "wikilink"), [medical
terminals](/Medical_Terminal "wikilink"), [certification
terminals](/Certification_Terminal "wikilink"), [vehicle
terminals](/Vehicle_Terminal "wikilink"), [respawn
tubes](/Respawn_Tube "wikilink"), [TRAPs](/TRAP "wikilink"), [Aegis Shield
Generators](/Aegis_Shield_Generator "wikilink"), [Motion
Sensors](/ACE#Motion_Sensor_Alarm "wikilink"), [Sensor
Disruptors](/Sensor_Disruptor "wikilink"), [implant
terminals](/Implant_Terminal "wikilink"), and
[generators](/Generator "wikilink"). Just be sure to carry an extra ammo
canister or three for it, as major items like generators and vehicles
will use up much more "juice" to get back up to full status.

With the [Fortification
Engineering](/Fortification_Engineering "wikilink")
[Certification](/Certification "wikilink"), the Nano Dispenser can also
be used to upgrade [Phalanx](/Phalanx "wikilink") turrets via the
[Upgrade Canister](/Upgrade_Canister "wikilink") to fire either
Anti-Aircraft or Anti-Armor rounds in addition to the standard rounds.
It can also be used to upgrade [Aegis Shield
Generators](/Aegis_Shield_Generator "wikilink") with a static shield
using the [Armor Canister](/Armor_Canister "wikilink") ammunition with
the Fortification Engineering certification.

With the [Assault Engineering](/Assault_Engineering "wikilink")
certification, the Nano Dispenser can be used upgrade Aegis Shield
Generators to supply ammunition and hand-held
[grenades](/grenade "wikilink") using Armor Canister ammunition. If you
also have Fortificantion Engineering, the Aegis must have been
previously upgraded to have a static shield and the shield must be at
full health to begin the ammunition upgrade.

For each unit of [Armor Canister](/Armor_Canister "wikilink") ammunition,
a [standard engineer](/Engineering "wikilink") using the Nano Dispenser
will repair an object 32 armor points. A player with the [Combat
Engineering](/Combat_Engineering "wikilink")
[Certification](/Certification "wikilink") will repair at a rate of 48
points per unit. Characters with
[Fortification](/Fortification_Engineering "wikilink"),
[Assault](/Assault_Engineering "wikilink"), or [Advanced
Engineering](/Advanced_Engineering "wikilink") have the highest Nano
Dispenser efficiency, repairing at a rate of 64 armor points per unit of
ammunition.
