Version 1.8.8 (Aug. 21, 2003)

There will be a patch on August 21, 2003 at 3 AM Pacific Time. It will
include the following items:

- The [Lattice Logic Unit](Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) now appears
  on the overhead map - even when carried.
- The [LLU](LLU.md) will only spawn in one location per base
  rather than one of several random points. These locations are listed
  in the online manual.
- Fixed a bug preventing landing pads at [Interlink
  Facilities](Interlink_Facility.md) from detecting
  collisions. Aircraft can land on them again.
- Users will not be kicked from vehicles upon changing access
  permissions.
- The [ATV](ATV.md) certification is now 2 cert points
- Hover vehicles no longer take damage while traveling over uneven
  terrain.
- New audio sounds associated with [LLU](LLU.md).
- Fixed several zone and server crashes.
- Grammar corrections in various in-game dialogs.
- The [Starfire](Starfire.md) now matches the
  [Sparrow's](Sparrow.md) acceleration and projectile speed.
