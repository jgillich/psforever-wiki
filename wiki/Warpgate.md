Warpgate is a gigantic, hemispherically-shaped ancient artifact used to
teleport individuals and vehicles from one
[continent](continent.md "wikilink") to another. There are 3 to 4 warpgates
located on each continent and [sanctuary](sanctuary.md "wikilink"), each
linked to a [planet](planet.md "wikilink") light years away.

If the warpgate's host continent is
[locked](continental_lock.md "wikilink"), or it is linked to a locked
continent via a [continental lattice](lattice.md "wikilink") chain, it
becomes a [Broadcast Warpgate (BWG)](Broadcast_warpgate.md "wikilink") and
can transport an individual across the [Galactic
Lattice](Galactic_Lattice.md "wikilink") to any planet in the lattice
chain.

You cannot enter warpgates that link to an enemy
[sanctuary](sanctuary.md "wikilink") (found on enemy [Home
Continents](Home_Continent.md "wikilink")). These warpgates are shaded the
color of the controling empire on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink"). The bubble will act as a solid
structure for enemies (thus you cannot fill up an [ANT](ANT.md "wikilink")
in these enemy warpgates).

Structurally, a warpgate consists of a large central platform, from
which emits a column of warp energy that shoots up and then encloses the
entire construct from top to bottom in a protective warp bubble. Three
thick support bracings extend outward from this central platform like
spokes on a wheel, each an equal distance from the other two. From these
spokes curve upward and inward three massive columns.

The warpgates are the land-based alternative to the [High Altitute Rapid
Transit Shuttle (HART)](HART.md "wikilink").

## Game Lore

The warpgates were the first Ancient artifacts discovered and inspected
by the Terran Republic expeditionary teams. It was the warp energy
signatures passing through the gates and along the
[lattice](lattice.md "wikilink") network that the scientists were able to
harness to create the weaponry, vehicles, and equipment.

The warpgates were also the first source of human Re-birthing, later
known as [respawning](respawn.md "wikilink"). After a human passed through
the warpgate energy beam, he could no longer stay dead. Instead he would
[respawn](respawn.md "wikilink") within one of the warpgates scattered
throughout the [Pre-Bending](The_Bending.md "wikilink") planet of
[Auraxis](Auraxis.md "wikilink").

The Terran scientists utilized this amazing property of the warpgates to
create the [Matrix Panels](Matrix_Panel.md "wikilink") and [Respawn
tubes](Respawn_tube.md "wikilink") used in the various
[facilities](facilities.md "wikilink") on each
[continent](continent.md "wikilink").

It is said that the scientists discovered how to create approximations
of the [Ancients](Ancients.md "wikilink")' vehicles and weaponry by
studying the warpgate energy.

Every day, the scientists and technicians of each
[Empire](Empire.md "wikilink") attempt to decipher the warpgate energy
patterns, testing ways to manipulate them for their own ends in order to
dominate the galaxy.
