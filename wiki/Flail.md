**Flail**

The **Flail** is an [Ancient-Tech](Ancient-Tech.md) (AT)
artillery platform. It has fairly high armor but travels at a low speed.
The Flail must be [deployed](deploy.md), immobilizing it, to
fire its devastating long-range energy projectiles. When not deployed it
cannot fire its weapon and is therefore defenseless. The vehicle can
only deploy on land, though its ability to hover allows it to travel
across inland stretches of water, but it cannot travel far beyond the
coast of a continent. The farther its projectiles travel, the more
damage they do (inverse [Damage
Degradation](Damage_Degradation.md)). The Flail works best when
supported by a squad leader of [Command Rank 1
(CR1)](Command_Rank.md) or a squad member utilizing the [Laze
Pointer](Laze_Pointer.md) to help it acquire a target. Both of
these systems give the Flail driver a special triangle shaped target.
Unfortunately, squad leader waypoints show the aim zone as it would be
if the target was at sea-level while the Laze Pointer, though harder to
use, shows the Flail user an aim point which is set to the elevation
above sea-level of the target, allowing the Flail user's first shot to
hit. A third way of targeting is done by the squad leader assigning the
squad experience waypoint (blue diamond) to a particular squad member
(done in the "manage" tab). An aiming point will be produced for the
flail and provides _perfect_ targeting information like the [laze
pointer](laze_pointer.md). Note however, that you will be
targeting the feet of your own squad member!

Laze Pointers may be obtained from the Flail itself, as well as all
[Equipment terminals](Equipment_terminal.md), and do not require
any special [Certifications](Certifications.md) to use.

The Flail requires a [Vehicle Module](Vehicle_Module.md) lattice
benefit, or linked [Cavern Lock Benefit](Cavern_Lock.md) in
order to be purchasable on the surface. To recharge the Flail's
capacitor, you must go to a [Repair/Rearm.md
Silo](Repair/Rearm_Silo.md) at a facility that has the [Vehicle
Module](Vehicle_Module.md) benefit, or use a [Vehicle Energy
Crystal](Vehicle_Energy_Crystal.md) in the
[Caverns](Caverns.md).
