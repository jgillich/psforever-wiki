Since I feel that I'm one of the more experienced
[Magrider](Magrider "wikilink") drivers in planetside, this guide is
meant to help others out.

\-[Quovatis](user:Quovatis "wikilink")

## Magrider Properties

I consider the [Magrider](Magrider "wikilink") to be the best tank in
planetside. While the [Prowler](Prowler "wikilink") and
[Vanguard](Vanguard "wikilink") are better in specific situations, the
[Magrider](Magrider "wikilink") is the most versatile. Your
[Magrider](Magrider "wikilink") has a driver weapon, the Pulsed-Particle
Accelerator (PPA). This weapon is mainly an anti-infantry weapon, but it
can also turn the battle in your favor versus enemy armor. The gunner
weapon is the railbeam. Unlike other tanks, this weapon has no arc and
travels very fast. It has limited splash damage, and takes three hits to
kill a rexo. The [Magrider](Magrider "wikilink") is also unique in that
it is the only tank that can travel over water. This is a big advantage.

## Driver Setup

![](images/magdriverloadout.jpg "fig:magdriverloadout.JPG") driver loadout\]\]
When you acquire your [Magrider](Magrider "wikilink") you should have a
favorite with 4 boxes of PPA and 2 boxes of Rail Beam ammo. This should
be your normal loadout, as the PPA goes through ammo quickly. However,
if you plan on doing a lot of water driving or long range sniping, you
should get 3 or 4 boxes of Rail Beam, as you won't be using the PPA
much. Your favorite should also have a spare glue gun, 5 boxes of glue,
and perhaps a medpack. This allows you to carry less glue in your
infantry loadout, saving space for other things...

![](images/MagTrunk.jpg "fig:MagTrunk.JPG") [Favorite](Favorites "wikilink")
for the [Magrider](Magrider "wikilink")\]\] If you do a lot of tank
driving, you should have a favorite with a box of PPA ammo, a glue gun,
a pulsar, glue, a REK (sometimes you might need to take a tower), and
whatever else you can get in there. I prefer the
[Pulsar](Pulsar "wikilink") to the [Lasher](Lasher "wikilink") because
you can hot swap with the glue gun directly and it saves space. The
[Pulsar](Pulsar "wikilink") also provides medium-range fire that the
lasher cannot provide if you come under attack while repairing. Have the
pulsar in the rifle slot just in case you come across an enemy going to
the vehicle pad. If you are CR3 or higher, take a CUD along for clearing
minefields or OSing that noob stationary [BFR](BFR "wikilink") you come
across.

The implants I recommend are [Enhanced
Targeting](Enhanced_Targeting "wikilink"),
[Darklight](Darklight "wikilink"), and [Audio
Amplifier](Audio_Amplifier "wikilink"). Always have Audio Amp on, and
Darklight lets you run over those pesky cloakers.

## Driver Tactics

Before I go any further, let me say that if your gunner is not on voice
comms with you, you're only operating at 50% efficiency. A good driver
is worthless if your gunner can't help you out. Your gunner needs to be
able to convey threats to you and give you more situational awareness.

Your goal while driving is to keep the tank alive. Certain situations
dictate that you might need to sacrifice yourself to kill your target,
but you need to have the discipline to know when to disengage to avoid
death, even though your target just needs 1 or 2 more hits to kill.
Getting kills comes naturally, but only if you can keep the tank alive.
Disengaging and quickly repairing will yield more kills over time than
killing that one tank while getting killed yourself, then pulling a new
tank.

Your secondary goal is to get kills, or more specifically drive such
that your gunner can get kills. The main advantage of the magrider is
its long range weapon. You want to keep as much distance between you and
your target as possible. Your gunner should let you know if the target
is out of range. Find a target. Stay at maximum range and stationary to
engage if not under fire. If you are on water, you can move as much as
you like, as long as you stay in range.

- Roads: Avoid roads if at all possible. Always assume the roads are
  filled with mines. If you must drive on the road, drive as far to
  the side as possible.

<!-- -->

- Water: Water is your friend. Drive on water whenever possible. If
  you hug the shoreline, your speed will not decrease. The main
  benefit of water is that it provides a stable surface for your
  gunner. Driving in long circles out in the middle of the water
  allows your gunner to hit almost anything with pinpoint accuracy,
  while dodging almost all enemy fire. I've literally done this for 5
  minutes with multiple enemies trying to kill us.

<!-- -->

- Hills: Avoid when you can, as it is very hard for the gunner to hit
  anything. However, sometimes getting on top of a hill overlooking a
  base can yield many kills. If you strafe while going up a hill, you
  get more torque out of the tank, so keep that in mind.

<!-- -->

- Trees: Trees are the friend of an experienced
  [Magrider](Magrider "wikilink") driver, but can be deadly for the
  inexperienced. Your tank is not as wide as the other tanks, and you
  can slip through the trees and run away easily. Inexperienced
  drivers will get stuck in the trees, leading to death many times.

You should be glancing at your mini-map (radar) every second or 2. You
need to watch out for [Liberators](Liberator "wikilink") lining you up
all the time. Fixating on a target for 5 seconds is enough time for
bombs to come out of nowhere and kill you. Pay attention at all times.
The minimap also lets you see potential targets. The
[Mosquito](Mosquito "wikilink")'s overflight radar data is transmitted
to you as well, letting you see targets you might not otherwise. Motion
detectors also give you information, but you will miss it if you don't
constantly look at your radar. It also lets you see how the tank your
gunner is engaging moves, allowing you to determine which way you need
to turn to follow or run.

Remember you have a weapon too. Many times you will get killed if you
don't use it, but other times you might get too fixated on a target and
not pay attention to driving and keeping you alive (your main goal).
Lone infantry are perfect prey for the PPA. Hit them a few times with
the PPA, then run over them. Always be aware for traps, however. Trying
to run over infantry sometimes leads you straight into a minefield. If
you find a minefield, stop as soon as possible. Reverse course, and go
as you came.

Repair whenever possible. If you are less than half health, you need to
repair immediately unless you are in a 1 vs 1 battle and you think you
can finish them. Even if you are only slightly damaged, repair if you
are not under fire, as that extra health might save you in just a few
seconds. Usually you want to go away from the battle to repair, but if
you're on a good hill or at long range, you can turn your tank to block
fire, and repair yourself in battle. While you are out, your gunner is
actually more accurate, as the tank will not be bouncing up and down as
normal. When repairing, your gunner should do a quick darklight sweep to
look for cloakers. If it's clear and you don't expect enemies, the
gunner should help you repair. You should almost require your gunner
have a glue gun, or else you will spend a lot of time repairing
yourself, which is a waste of time. If you have [Amp
Station](Amp_Station "wikilink") benefit, try to repair inside a
friendly [SOI](SOI "wikilink") to build shields while you repair. If you
have [Dropship Center](Dropship_Center "wikilink") benefit, get ammo and
let your gunner repair you at the repair silo if it's clear.

If you drive conservatively, you can live for hours with the same tank,
and get 100+ assists easily. Too many tank drivers I gun for drive
straight into the battle, and never repair.

## Target-Specific Tactics

- Aircraft: Reavers are the main threat here, but all aircraft are
  treated the same. You have two choices: try to kill it, or drag him
  by friendlies. If you chose to kill it, find water and drive in
  circles. You gunner should hopefully be able to kill him easily. If
  you can't find water, find a relatively flat spot of ground, and
  strafe slowly in one direction. This lets your gunner have a stable
  platform and you might dodge a few missiles. If there are no flat
  spots around, if you are badly damaged, or if the aircraft is smart
  and flies almost directly overhead, head for the trees and
  friendlies.

<!-- -->

- [Lightnings](Lightning "wikilink"): Not much of a threat. Usually
  you can just snipe them at long range, or head straight in for the
  kill. If there are lots of them, keep moving to avoid fire. Use the
  PPA for even quicker kills.
- [Fury](Fury "wikilink"): One of your biggest threats. Second only to
  the reaver, you should kill these first. The rockets from the
  [Fury](Fury "wikilink") do massive damage. Lure them to open ground
  where you can kill them easily.
- Flight Variant [BFRs](BFR "wikilink"): These BFRs have the same top
  speed as a Mag while in run mode. Get out on water and run in
  circles. Disengage if you get badly hurt. You can win 1 on 1 with a
  flight variant if you drive well, but engage cautiously. If anything
  else starts shooting at you, break away.
- Sunderer Variants ([Vindicator](Vindicator "wikilink"),
  [Juggernaut](Juggernaut "wikilink"), and
  [Leviathan](Leviathan "wikilink")): Though all very similar in
  firepower, the Vindicator has a slight edge because of the high
  damage of the 20mm and the projectile veolocity, but you can treat
  all variants the same. The biggest threat these vehicles pose is
  their [EMP](EMP "wikilink") blast. Stay as far away as possible to
  engage, so you stay out of the blast range. Zig-zag to avoid the
  75mm fire, as this is the majority of their firepower. The profile
  is so big that it's hard to miss them at any range, so don't be shy
  about staying far away. If you come on one them by surprise another
  tactic you can use is to stay as close as possible to them. You will
  stay below their gun arc (unless they have a
  [ballgunner](ballgun "wikilink"), but it doesn't do much damage) and
  will be relatively safe. However, you are prone to EMP blasts and
  the splash from your own railbeam weapon, so only use this tactic if
  you are isolated from heavy fighting or know that they already used
  their EMP.
- [One-Manned Field Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret "wikilink"): All
  OMFTs are similar and suffer from damage degredation. Get too close
  and you will be shredded up. The range of the turrets is 250m, so
  you have 50m more range to use to your advantage. Avoid close
  encounters unless you are at full health, and finish them off if you
  get the chance, as their shields recharge and you don't want to
  waste your efforts.

<!-- -->

- [New Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate "wikilink")
  - [Vanguard](Vanguard "wikilink"): Probably the easiest enemy tank
    to kill. While they have the most armor, and heaviest hitting
    gun, they lack mobility and rate of fire. However, if you engage
    at close range, you will likely die. Engage at medium-long range
    and move to avoid fire. If you must engage at close range, use
    the PPA and weave through trees. If you can't get the first 3 or
    4 rail beam shots on him before he notices you, you probably
    need to disengage. If one is following you, head for water, or
    trees. Vanguards have a really tough time in trees. When they
    get stuck in the trees, circle back and finish them off.
  - [Thunderer](Thunderer "wikilink"): I fear this vehicle the most
    of any enemy vehicle. It has direct fire weapons, meaning that
    most of your normal tactics don't work. Running for water might
    not be the best choice when facing thunderers because if they
    follow you into the water, only half of their surface area is
    hittable, while you are no different. Keep as far away from
    thunderers as possible, where you still can dodge their slow
    projectiles. If you find dueling one at close range, you MUST
    engage with the PPA. It is the ONLY way you will win, as the
    Thunderer with two gunners has a faster time to kill on a
    Magrider, than the Rail Beam alone can match.
  - [Enforcer](Enforcer "wikilink"): Usually not much of a threat,
    unless they are in packs. They are fast, however, which makes
    killing them a little tricky.
  - [Phoenix](Phoenix "wikilink"): While the Phoenix has a slow rate
    of fire, when it does hit, it hurts. Avoid hills where Phoenix
    users can hide. If there is just one, close and kill. Watch your
    minimap for the direction. The main limitation is its range.
    When running from Phoenixes, run in a straight line away from
    the user. Hopefully the fuse will burn out before it gets to
    you. Sometimes weaving in trees can scrape off inexperienced
    Phoenix users.
  - [Peregrine](Peregrine "wikilink"): If it has the particle cannon
    as the gunner weapon (which almost all of them do), avoid at all
    costs. The particle cannon can kill you very quickly and is very
    accurate. Don't fire upon it to let them know you are there, and
    only fire on it if it's hurting or others are helping you. The
    shield regeneration rate of a crouched [BFR](BFR "wikilink") is
    only slightly less than the damage the rail beam can deliver.
    You will be shooting at it a very long time if you think you
    will kill it alone.

<!-- -->

- [Terran Republic](Terran_Republic "wikilink")
  - [Prowler](Prowler "wikilink"): This is your biggest enemy tank
    threat. At close range, the [Prowler](Prowler "wikilink") will
    kill you in the blink of an eye, especially with 2 gunners. Use
    the same tactics as the [Vanguard](Vanguard "wikilink") above.
    Stay as far away as possible and lure them into trees or head
    for water.
  - [Raider](Raider "wikilink"): While not as deadly as the
    [Thunderer](Thunderer "wikilink"), at point blank range, you
    will still have a hard time winning. Keep as far away as
    possible, where the damage of the raider is less. Like the
    tactics for the [Thunderer](Thunderer "wikilink"), water might
    not always be the right choice.
  - [Marauder](Marauder "wikilink"): Very little threat unless you
    are heavily damaged. Pursue and destroy, but watch for their
    heavy hitting brothers. This vehicle can carry 3
    striker-equipped troops. They pose a bigger threat when the bail
    and [Striker](Striker "wikilink") you. Kill them before they can
    bail.
  - [Striker](Striker "wikilink"): A lone striker is no threat, but
    it seems like just about every TR player has one. If you get
    locked on, head for obstacles to break the lock. Even if you do
    break the lock, you need to change direction, since the rocket
    can sill hit you if you don't.
  - [Colossus](Colossus "wikilink"): Not as bad as the
    [Peregrine](Peregrine "wikilink"), but still just as hard to
    kill. Treat like a [Prowler](Prowler "wikilink") to avoid fire.

<!-- -->

- [Vanu Sovereignty](Vanu_Sovereignty "wikilink")
  - [Magrider](Magrider "wikilink"): Rarely encountered, but a big
    threat. Head for trees, where you will likely make the less
    experienced magrider driver get hung up.
  - [Aurora](Aurora "wikilink"): Laugh at them after you kill them.
    Not a big threat.
  - [Thresher](Thresher "wikilink"): Keep moving to avoid fire.
    Treat like an [Enforcer](Enforcer "wikilink").
  - [Lancer](Lancer "wikilink"): Not much you can do to avoid fire.
    Find cover and try to get out of range, though the range is
    huge. Trees might help.
  - [Aphelion](Aphelion "wikilink"): If you ever find one of these,
    it's rare. They have decent anti-vehicular armorment, so it's
    best to stay away. It's harder to dodge hits, since the fire is
    direct fire.

## Gunner Guide

![](images/MagGunnerLoadout.jpg "fig:MagGunnerLoadout.JPG") gunner loadout.
Replace the [CUD](CUD "wikilink") with two more boxes of glue if not CR3
or above. More glue should always be in the trunk.\]\] As stated before,
ideally you need to be on voice comms with your driver. You don't have
time to type "I see a vanguard on the other hill, steady me for a
second". If you know you will be gunning, your loadout should carry two
boxes of rail beam ammo and one box of PPA. You should have a glue gun,
and a [Lasher](Lasher "wikilink") if you have it certed, though a
[Pulsar](Pulsar "wikilink") is fine too. You don't need to carry more
than 1 or two boxes of repair juice, since hopefully your driver has
plenty in the trunk if you run out. Recommended implants are [Enhanced
Targeting](Enhanced_Targeting "wikilink") and
[Darklight](Darklight "wikilink"). The third slot is up to you, but
[Audio Amplifier](Audio_Amplifier "wikilink") is probably best.

Like driving, the gunner needs to be looking at the radar screen every
few seconds. It might alert you of that cloaker that is right next to
you or a liberator lining you up. If you see puffs of green smoke ahead,
that's likely an enemy cloaker laying mines down. Anticipate where he is
and shoot him. Don't fixate too much on any given target. While you're
firing at that [Prowler](Prowler "wikilink") a mile away, your driver
might have just run into a [Thunderer](Thunderer "wikilink") at point
blank range and needs your help pronto.

Your main goal while gunning is to defend the tank. Your secondary goal
is to attack targets. Thus if you are chasing a
[Vanguard](Vanguard "wikilink") but a [Reaver](Reaver "wikilink") is
killing you, you need to direct fire at the Reaver first.

You should always target the least armored and most heavily armed
targets first. A rough order of threats that you should engage when on
the defense:

- [Reaver](Reaver "wikilink"): Probably your biggest threat, so they
  should always be priority if you know they see you.
- [Fury](Fury "wikilink"): Very damaging weapon, but relatively easy
  to kill. Kill first.
- AV [MAX](MAX "wikilink") units: [Falcon](Falcon "wikilink") is not
  much a threat, but if a [Pounder](Pounder "wikilink") if firing at
  you, it should be second only to the reaver, as they can kill you
  very quickly.
- Nearby Anti-Vehicular Troops: If you have a good line of sight on
  them, target them before enemy tanks. But if they are hiding behind
  trees or cover, ignore.
- Tanks: Low on the list, but they have high firepower if they are
  nearby.
- [Thunderer](Thunderer "wikilink") and [Raider](Raider "wikilink"):
  Low armor, but high damage output. As stated earlier, we want to
  avoid contact at close range, but if you do, these should be second
  only to the reaver.
- Assault Buggies: Not much of a threat, so these should be a very low
  priority when under fire.
- Sunderer Variants: Moderate threat, but takes a long time to take
  down. Engage if it's the only threat, but ignore if there are
  deadlier enemies out there.
- [Mosquito](Mosquito "wikilink") Usually not much of a threat, but
  likely a quick take-down.
- [BFRs](BFR "wikilink"): Lowest of all, since you almost ask for
  death if you start shooting them. If they are hurt or others are
  engaging with you, take them out.

On the attack, you should be targeting [AMSes](AMS "wikilink"), tanks,
and [MAX](MAX "wikilink") units in that order as priority, though it's
never bad to work in a quick infantry kill when possible.

When your driver stops to repair, do a quick darklight sweep of the area
to check for cloakers, especially near [Lodestars](Lodestar "wikilink").
After that, you need to make a judgment to either help repair, or stay
in the gun. Only experience will help you make the decision.

The most important job of the gunner is to communicate the surroundings
to the driver, which is best done through voice comms. If you are
pursuing a target, the driver usually knows the situation quite well,
though if something starts attacking you from behind, you need to start
talking to the driver. If something is following you, YOU need to become
the commander of the tank. If the target following you is hurting badly,
and you're a little better off, but the target stops following you, you
need to make a decision. One choice would be to tell the driver to turn
around and finish him off, though if you think it's too big a risk, tell
him to keep running. The driver can't see behind you, so you need to
tell him what's happening. When on the attack, you need to talk as well.
You should be saying things like "steady me for a second", "no shot,
move left a little", "target is out of range", "target is down, we're
clear", or "get us out of here". Without the driver having this
information, you're only running at 50% efficiency.

A good driver and gunner can easily play for 3 hours and have a 50 to 1
kill to death ratio. You will get killed, there is no avoiding it, but
by following this guide, you will have already made your mark...for
quite a long time hopefully.

## New CE Addendum

With the addition of the new [Combat
Engineering](Combat_Engineering "wikilink"), several new tactics can be
introduced. The main change for tank drivers is the use of the [Aegis
Shield Generator](Aegis_Shield_Generator "wikilink"). By having an
[FDU](FDU "wikilink") either in you or your gunner's inventory, or in
your mag's [trunk](trunk "wikilink"), you can make a cloaked repair
station. When you get out to repair, place an Aegis down beside you.
This will cloak you while you repair. If you plan on coming back to the
same spot for a while, you might consider charging the shield up to
provide even more cover. Note, however, that charging the shield takes a
signigicant amount of "glue", time, and the FDU takes up a lot of room
to store. Thus, be sure you still have enough glue to repair the mag
itself, as you cannot get more from the Aegis. Usually it's not worth
the time to charge the shield, but the cloaking effect is well worth it.

[Cerberus Turrets](Cerberus_Turret "wikilink") are also a nice addition
for tank drivers. Place 1 or 2 of these at your repair site to scare
away enemy air cav. You can also set up many more in a single area and
use it as a retreating point to scare off that
[Reaver](Reaver "wikilink") that is chasing you.

The new Anti-Vehicular [Wall Turret](Wall_Turret "wikilink") can make
quick work of a mag. The damage per second is roughly equivalent to the
[Prowler](Prowler "wikilink")! These upgraded turrets should be taken
out whenever possible. Treat like a [Colossus](Colossus "wikilink"):
stay far away and strafe to avoid fire and engage with the long range of
the rail beam.

[TRAPs](TRAP "wikilink") are usually not a great concern to a Magrider.
You usually see them on bridges, but Mags can easily avoid bridges. Be
aware that you can drive stright through a friendly TRAP as if it were
not there.
