Each character in [PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md "wikilink") is a member of one
of three [Empires](Empires.md "wikilink") (teams):

- [New Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate.md "wikilink")
- [Terran Republic](Terran_Republic.md "wikilink")
- [Vanu Sovereignty](Vanu_Sovereignty.md "wikilink")

Each [Empire](Empires.md "wikilink") is different in its philosophy, which
carries into the Empire-Specific weapons and vehicles.

Once a character has selected an [Empire](Empires.md "wikilink") that
character cannot change Empires.
