"Anti-Infantry" refers to weapons, configurations, or ammunition that is
designed to be effective against infantry only, usually having little
effect on [Vehicles](Vehicle_Index.md) or [MAX](MAX.md)
armor.

For example, white 9mm are anti-infantry, while gold 9mm rounds are
[Armor Piercing](Armor_Piercing.md). While the former is very
effective against enemy troops, it will do little damage to a MAX or a
tank. [category:Terminology](category:Terminology.md)
