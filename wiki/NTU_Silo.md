![](images/NTUSiloPicture.jpg "fig:NTUSiloPicture.jpg") The **NTU Silo** is an
object in all [facility](facilities.md "wikilink") courtyards which stores
[NTUs](NTU.md "wikilink") for use by the facility's
[generator](generator.md "wikilink").

[Advanced Nanite Transports](Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md "wikilink") use
the **NTU Silo** as a drop-off point for their load of NTUs. An **NTU
Silo** also has a small light, located on top of a pole attached to the
top of the Silo, which displays different colors depending on the
facilities current NTU status (Green is Full, or close to full, Yellow
is running low, and Red is critical need for more NTUs).

A Status Bar type display is also located on the front of the Silo,
informing all units of the facilities current NTU status at a glance.

The [BFR](BFR.md "wikilink") [NTU Siphon](NTU_Siphon.md "wikilink") weapon
system can be used in front of this silo to charge itself, and drain the
base in the process. It can also deposit NTUs back into friendly bases.
