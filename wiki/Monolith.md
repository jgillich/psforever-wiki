**Monoliths** are golden crystalline structures found all over the many
worlds of [Auraxis](Auraxis.md).

They serve two purposes:

1.) Locations to find on every world in order to earn the [Exploration
Merit](<Exploration_(Merit)>)

2.) Items used in the many [Events](Events.md) in PlanetSide,
including the [BFR Mayhem](BFR_Mayhem.md) event, the [Run For
the Guns](Run_For_the_Guns.md) event, and the [Galactic
Pathways](Galactic_Pathways.md) event.
