The **Immortal Sovereigns** was an [Outfit](Outfit.md "wikilink")
originally created by Aryo on the [Konried](Konried.md "wikilink") server
at the release of the [PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md "wikilink") in May of 2003.

It's been a very active outfit since, having seen such memorable leaders
as Skyshot, Johnypilgrim, ISFizz, and currently Spartikus-k.

Overall the outfit has a casual play-style that focuses on organization
and special ops a couple times a week to keep people sharp. We regularly
field 1-2 squads in the evenings and small 2-5 man squads during the
day.

The **Immortal Sovereigns** host their own
[TeamSpeak](TeamSpeak.md "wikilink") server and forums and has grown into a
large gaming group with guilds, outfits, or supergroups on games like
EverQuest 2, World of Warcraft, and City of Heroes just to name a few.

We enjoy working with other outfits and are absolutely at home in
armored columns, [Galaxy](Galaxy.md "wikilink") drops on
[Towers](Towers.md "wikilink"), to plain old base defense. We like to do it
all!
