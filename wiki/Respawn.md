Respawning occurs after one has voluntarily
[deconstructed](deconstruct "wikilink"), or died and "released" their
corpse. A player will then reappear in a [Respawn
tube](Respawn_tube "wikilink") or
[AMS](Advanced_Mobile_Station "wikilink") cloak bubble, wearing a
[Standard Exo-Suit](Standard_Exo-Suit "wikilink") and minimal weapons
and ammo.

A [Respawn timer](Respawn_timer "wikilink") governs how quickly a player
transitions from death to respawning. The timer increases with each
death, but can be reduced by staying alive longer or with the [Bio
Laboratory](Bio_Laboratory "wikilink") or [Speed
Module](Speed_Module "wikilink") benefits.

Respawning is sometimes refered to simply as Spawning.

A player typically has 4 spawn points: the closest friendly-controlled
[base](base "wikilink"), [tower](tower "wikilink"), and
[AMS](AMS "wikilink"), if they exist, in addition to the
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink"), which is always available. If the
player has [bound](bind "wikilink") to an AMS and/or base, or has an
active [Squad Home Base](Squad_Home_Base "wikilink"), he/she may respawn
there as well even if they are not the closest base/AMS. In the
[Caverns](Caverns "wikilink"), the closest [Module
Building](Module_Building "wikilink") and [Redoubt
Building](Redoubt_Building "wikilink") are available to spawn from, if
your empire controls them.
