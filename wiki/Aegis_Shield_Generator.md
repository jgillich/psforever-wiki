**Aegis Shield Generator**

The Aegis Shield Generator is similar to the Cloaking bubble of an
[Advanced Mobile Station](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md), as it
hides anything inside of its bubble from sight. [Fortification
Engineers](Fortification_Engineering.md) can upgrade the Aegis
to have a shield by repairing it with a [Nano
Dispenser](Nano_Dispenser.md) (normal ammunition). A fully
upgraded shield provides roughly the equivalent of a
[Phalanx](Phalanx.md) Wall Turret worth of armor protection.
Aegis Shield work rather similar to the one gained by a [Shield
Module](Shield_Module.md). They block all fire, both enemy and
friendly, as well as enemy [vehicles](vehicle.md). Note that
friendly fire at the shield will reduce the Shield's power.

The Aegis Shield Generator can also be upgraded by [Assault
Engineers](Assault_Engineering.md) with ammunition benefits.
This benefit eventually wears off and will need to be re-upgraded
periodically. The status of the Aegis can be seen by double clicking on
the Aegis deployable icon on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md). Note that if a character has both
Fortification and Assault Engineering (or [Advanced
Engineering](Advanced_Engineering.md)), upgrading the shields
takes priority, and thus to upgrade to ammunition benefits, the shield
must first be at full strength.

[Assault Engineers](Assault_Engineering.md) can only place 1
Aegis Shield Generator at any given time. As with all the other
Deployables, if the Engineer tries to deploy a second one, the first one
will deconstruct. Note however, that friendlies might be using your
Shield Generator as cover, and will be exposed to enemy fire if you
deconstruct it!

The interference range of the Aegis is the same as that of an
[AMS](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md). The Aegis shares the same
interference ranges as the [Tactical Resonance Area Protection
(TRAP)](Tactical_Resonance_Area_Protection.md) and the
[One-Manned Field Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret.md).

Soldiers certified in [Data Corruption](Data_Corruption.md) or
[Electronics Expert](Electronics_Expert.md) can use their
[T-REK](T-REK.md) to infect enemy Aegis shields with a
[Virus](Virus.md). This virus causes the Aegis to emit a [Pain
Field](Pain_Field.md), harming any friendly unit inside its
bubble.

[Expert Hackers](Expert_Hacking.md) or [Electronics
Experts](Electronics_Expert.md) can remove an enemy virus from
the Aegis and also use their [REK](REK.md) to hack a friendly
Aegis to provide a short-ranged [Interlink](Interlink.md)
benefit around it for friendly units. However, the radar is only active
for friendly units that are inside the cloaking sphere of the Aegis.
Like the ammunition upgrade, the radar eventually wears off over time
and will need to be re-upgraded for continual use.
