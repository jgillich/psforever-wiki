Similar to [Empire Incentives](Empire_Incentives.md), Global
incentives adjust [experience point](BEP.md) bonuses based upon
population disadvantages. The bonus percentage is the percent difference
between the highest [empire](empire.md) population and yours.
For example, if the global populations are 40%, 35%, and 25% for the
[TR](Terran_Republic.md), [NC](New_Conglomerate.md), and [VS](Vanu_Sovereignty.md),
respectively, the TR would receive no bonus, the NC would receive a +5%
[BEP](BEP.md) bonus, and the VS would receive a +15% bonus.
These apply to the entire empire across the server on any planet or
continent. Respawn and purchase bonuses are not awarded on a global
scale, only by [zone](zone.md).

Since patch [3.15.18](3.md.15.18), Global Incentives are now
calculated every few minutes instead of taking the average population
over the last few days. The calculated bonuses are added to any zone
bonus.
