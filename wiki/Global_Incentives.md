Similar to [Empire Incentives](/Empire_Incentives "wikilink"), Global
incentives adjust [experience point](/BEP "wikilink") bonuses based upon
population disadvantages. The bonus percentage is the percent difference
between the highest [empire](/empire "wikilink") population and yours.
For example, if the global populations are 40%, 35%, and 25% for the
[TR](/TR "wikilink"), [NC](/NC "wikilink"), and [VS](/VS "wikilink"),
respectively, the TR would receive no bonus, the NC would receive a +5%
[BEP](/BEP "wikilink") bonus, and the VS would receive a +15% bonus.
These apply to the entire empire across the server on any planet or
continent. Respawn and purchase bonuses are not awarded on a global
scale, only by [zone](/zone "wikilink").

Since patch [3.15.18](/3.15.18 "wikilink"), Global Incentives are now
calculated every few minutes instead of taking the average population
over the last few days. The calculated bonuses are added to any zone
bonus.
