Live Version 3.4.8 (February 27, 2005)

## BattleFrame Robotics Changes:

- [BFRs](BFR.md) are now affected by a water timer and can
  stay fully immersed for up to 60 seconds.
- While underwater, BFRs will move moderately slower than when on
  land.
- Flight BFR jet packs are now disabled while they are submerged.
- Moderately reduced the Flight BFR's capacitor and vertical flight
  capabilities.
- Adjusted the [Colossus](Colossus.md) Gunner movement rate up
  slightly to better match the other gunner BFRs.
- Slightly lowered the Flight BFR's total shield size (from 3,000
  damage absorbed to 2,500)
- Adjusted the Flight BFR's armor small arms fire absorption (from 7
  damage taken off per shot to 5 damage taken off per shot)

## Fixes:

- Corrected an issue that could have keymaps blank out after exiting
  and re-entering game
- Changed the [Cavalry Pilot](Cavalry_Pilot.md) (Bronze) Merit
  to correctly allow people who have the Qualification Merit to
  advance.
- Fixed a problem that could leave you only able to respawn at the
  [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md) after you died and were looking at
  other system maps.
- Fixed a client crash that could occur during shutdown
