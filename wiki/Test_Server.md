The [Test Server](Test_Server.md "wikilink") is a special server run by the
[PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md "wikilink") team. The Test Server is exactly the
same as the other three PlanetSide servers,
[Emerald](Emerald.md "wikilink"), [Markov](Markov.md "wikilink"), and
[Werner](Werner.md "wikilink"), except that the Test Server is used to test
future [patches](patch.md "wikilink"). Therefore, the Test Server receives
new patches earlier than other servers so that the players of PlanetSide
can test them and work out the bugs before the patches go to the live
[servers](server.md "wikilink"). The Test Server is generally less
populated than the Live Servers, so to make it easier on the players,
characters on the test server are automatically made at [Battle
Rank](Battle_Rank.md "wikilink") 20 so the player does not have to worry
about attaining battle ranks for certifications.

## Reaching the Test Server

1.  Find the PlanetSide directory on your hard drive.
2.  Copy the entire PlanetSide folder and create a copy somewhere else
    on your computer.
3.  Open the new PlanetSide folder and find the PlanetSideTest icon.
4.  Run this and wait for the game to patch.
5.  Hit the Play button.

The reason a player has to completely copy the PlanetSide directory is
so that the player has two distinct versions of PlanetSide - the current
live version and the Test Server version which is on a future patch. By
keeping two different PlanetSide folders, the player is able to easily
distinguish which is the live version and which is the test version.
