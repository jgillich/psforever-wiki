A macro is a prerecorded chat command accessed via a key on your [hotkey
bar](/HUD#Hotkey_Bar "wikilink").

A macro is created using the following command:

/macro nnn /n text

"nnn" is a 3 letter title you want to give this macro. "LFS" is commonly
used for a broadcast macro used in advertising for a squad invite.

"/n" is the channel you want the macro to appear in, such as /b
(broadcast), /l (local), /o (outfit), or (in very rare cases) /c
(command chat).

"text" is the text you want to have appear.

Example: /macro LFS /b BR17 CR2 with adv hack and air cav LFS

Hitting the key linked to the macro "LFS" in your [Hotkey
Bar](/HUD#Hotkey_Bar "wikilink") will then put "BR17 CR2 with adv hack
and air cav LFS" into your local broadcast channel.

You can also add [Color Codes](/Color_Codes "wikilink") to your macro to
add that extra colorful flare to it.
