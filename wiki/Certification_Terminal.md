Located on each [Empire](Empire.md "wikilink")'s
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink") and in [Bio Lab](Bio_Lab.md "wikilink")
Facilities only, Certification terminals are found on the upper and
lower floors of the [HART](HART.md "wikilink") building and are used for
the purchasing and forgetting of
[Certifications](Certifications.md "wikilink").

To use, simply approach the terminal and press the Use key (default G),
as instructed on-screen.

The interface is simple; a list on the left shows the certifications
available for purchase and the right is split into two panels, the upper
showing a description of the currently selected cert and any
prerequisites, and the lower listing the certs the character currently
posesses. The number of available [Certification
points](Certification_points.md "wikilink") is shown at the top, and the
time remaining until another cert may be forgotten is shown underneath.

Certification Terminals can be destroyed as of [2.5.5](2.md.5.5 "wikilink")
