**Emerald** was the PlanetSide server that was located on the eastern
coast of the United States (Maryland). On May 20, 2008, Emerald was
merged with the [Markov](Markov.md "wikilink") server to create the
[Gemini](Gemini.md "wikilink") server.

**Emerald's** characterbase was a combination of characters from Emerald
as well as the shut down [Konried](Konried.md "wikilink") server.

Characters who came from [Konried](Konried.md "wikilink") whose names were
already in use on **Emerald** have a "-K" appended to the end of their
names. These names transfer to Gemini. If another character already
existed on Markov before the server merge and had priority over the
Emerald name, a "-E" was appended to the end of the Markov's character
name. [Outfit](Outfit.md "wikilink") names followed a similar rule. See
[Gemini](Gemini.md "wikilink") for more information on character and outfit
naming rules and how to change them if they have a "-M" or "-E"
appended.
