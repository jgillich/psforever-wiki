**Gauss Cannon Ammunition**

These rounds are used by the [Thunderer](Thunderer.md "wikilink") and fire
in a straight-line trajectory though move relatively slowly. They do
massive damage, killing any infantry in one shot. It has a very small
splash damage area. The small quantity of rounds per box means that a
Thunderer will need to reload regularly in the field. The boxes can be
obtained from any [Equipment Terminal](Equipment_Terminal.md "wikilink") to
be hand-loaded into the vehicle's [trunk](trunk.md "wikilink") or acquired
while in the vehicle from a [Repair/Rearm
Silo](Repair.md/Rearm_Silo "wikilink").
