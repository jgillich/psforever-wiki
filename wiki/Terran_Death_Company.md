Terran Death Company is an old outfit, approximately 5 years old. After
a slump, TDC is back on the rise and their members have been seen in
increasing numbers.

They primarily run operations with their trained members, and are in
constant communication with Ventrilo.

If you're interested in the outfit, send one of the officers a tell, or
