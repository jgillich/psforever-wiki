Horus is a [Bio Laboratory](Bio_Laboratory.md) on southern
[Solsar](Solsar.md). Nearby are a [Gun
tower](Gun_tower.md), 116m to the north-east, and [Technology
Plant](Technology_Plant.md) [Amun](Amun.md),
approximately 400m to the East.

The front door faces west, towards the nearby hills. There is a
[pillbox](Pillbox.md) outside the north wall facing north.

There are hills to the east that provide a good sniper point to the
front door. There is also a hill to north that has a good vantage point
of the [Vehicle Terminal](Vehicle_Terminal.md). The land to the
south and west is more flat, but the numerous rocks and trees make
driving vehicles a bit troublesome.
