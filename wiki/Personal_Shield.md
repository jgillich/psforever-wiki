**Personal Shield** is one of the most popular
[implants](implants.md) for zerglings and skilled players alike.
Its effect is simple: It allows you to use your
[stamina](stamina.md) to absorb damage taken at a 1 to 1 ratio.
This, essentially, gives you 100 more armor, enough to take an extra
sniper bullet or survive that extra second you need to kill an enemy
before he kills you. Unfortunately, Personal Shield (or P-Shield, or PS
for short) has a tendency to run you completely out of stamina, forcing
you to walk and disabling all your implants until you regenerate 20
stamina.

Some players use a strategy combining [Second
Wind](Second_Wind.md) and P-Shield to allow them to absorb even
more damage by activating Personal Shield just after Second Wind kicks
in.
