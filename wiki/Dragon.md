**Dragon**

The Dragon is a flamethrower that can either fire a continuous stream of
flames in primary mode, or shoot a "bomb" of fire, which will explode
and ignite anyone nearby. The range of the Dragon is limited, but its
damage output is very high, and can quickly kill Infantry and
[MAXs](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) alike.

The primary mode fires a short burst of flames, consuming 5 ammunition.
Once started, the burst must finish firing, but holding down the fire
key can fire successive bursts. The flames travel fairly slowly, but if
anything is caught in the way, they are toast...literally.

The secondary fire mode fires what's called a "Sunburst": a slow moving
ball of fire. When it reaches its explosion distance or hits the ground,
it explodes igniting anyone nearby. The initial blast does quite a bit
of damage and players will continue to burn for a short period
afterward. The Sunburst consumes 50 ammunition and has a 3 second refire
delay. With a magazine taking up a 4x4 inventory space, use this mode
sparingly, as it eats up ammo quickly!

The Dragon is free to those having the [Three Year Term of
Service](Term_of_Service.md) [merit](merit.md) or
available to those certing [Elite Assault](Elite_Assault.md).
The Dragon has a 3 minute acquisition timer.
