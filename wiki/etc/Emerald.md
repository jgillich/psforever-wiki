**Emerald** was the PlanetSide server that was located on the eastern coast of
the United States (Maryland). On May 20, 2008, Emerald was merged with the
[Markov](Markov.md) server to create the [Gemini](Gemini.md) server.

**Emerald's** characterbase was a combination of characters from Emerald as well
as the shut down [Konried](Konried.md) server.

Characters who came from [Konried](Konried.md) whose names were already in use
on **Emerald** have a "-K" appended to the end of their names. These names
transfer to Gemini. If another character already existed on Markov before the
server merge and had priority over the Emerald name, a "-E" was appended to the
end of the Markov's character name. [Outfit](../terminology/Outfit.md) names
followed a similar rule. See [Gemini](Gemini.md) for more information on
character and outfit naming rules and how to change them if they have a "-M" or
"-E" appended.
