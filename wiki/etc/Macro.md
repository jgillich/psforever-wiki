A macro is a prerecorded chat command accessed via a key on your
[hotkey bar](Heads-up_Display.md#Hotkey_Bar).

A macro is created using the following command:

/macro nnn /n text

"nnn" is a 3 letter title you want to give this macro. "LFS" is commonly used
for a broadcast macro used in advertising for a squad invite.

"/n" is the channel you want the macro to appear in, such as /b (broadcast), /l
(local), /o (outfit), or (in very rare cases) /c (command chat).

"text" is the text you want to have appear.

Example: /macro LFS /b BR17 CR2 with adv hack and air cav LFS

Hitting the key linked to the macro "LFS" in your
[Hotkey Bar](Heads-up_Display.md#Hotkey_Bar) will then put "BR17 CR2 with adv
hack and air cav LFS" into your local broadcast channel.

You can also add [Color Codes](../commands/Color_Codes.md) to your macro to add
that extra colorful flare to it.
