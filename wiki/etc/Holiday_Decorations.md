Decorations are occasionally added for major American commercial
holidays in October and December.

December decor includes Santa Hats, Lights on trees on
[Ceryshen](../locations/Ceryshen.md) and [Esamir](../locations/Esamir.md), and
replacing backpacks with gift-wrapped packages.

October decor replaces backpacks with empire-colored Jack-o-Lanterns.
