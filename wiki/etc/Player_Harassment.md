To deal with player harassment in-game, [SOE](Sony_Online_Entertainment.md) has
set up mutliple ways to deal with it. In game you can type:

- **/report <playername>** - Sends the chat log of that player that you see to
  the CS team for review.

<!-- -->

- **/appeal** - Opens a window where you can submit a ticket to the CS team.
