Bombing can be very rewarding. In the right situations, my bombardier
has made over 60 kills before we died. In other situations you will die
before you even make it to the target. This guide is intended to help
both the pilot and bombardier be successful and stay alive while
bombing. I will note that many pilots will tell you something completely
opposite of what I put in this guide. There might well be better tactics
out there that work in certain situations, but I have the [Bomber Ace
Auraxium](merits/Bomber_Ace.md) merit and this is what has worked for
me.

## Liberator and Vulture Properties

### Liberator

The [Liberator](../vehicles/Liberator.md) is the most used bomber and is
available to anyone with the [Air Support](../certifications/Air_Support.md)
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md). The nose gun is a powerful
35mm Chaingun that shreds every type of target from infantry to armor to
aircraft. The bomber seat can drop two types of bombs: Anti-Infantry
cluster bombs and Anti-Armor tank buster bombs. The tailgun fires
powerful 25mm rounds that are good on a variety of targets, though best
used for fending off enemy aircraft. The Liberator lacks an afterburner,
but can hold one more box of [ammunition](../items/Ammunition.md) than
the [Vulture](../vehicles/Vulture.md) in its [trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md).

### Vulture

The Vulture is a specialized bomber available to those who have the [Air
Support](../certifications/Air_Support.md) certification and also the [Bomber Ace
Bronze](merits/Bomber_Ace.md) [Merit
Commendation](../merits/Merit_Commendations.md). The nosegun of the vulture
used the same [35mm Chaingun Bullets](../ammunition/35mm_Chaingun_Bullets.md)
as the Liberator, but fires them more rapidly. The trade-off is the
damage per shot is much lower and takes a very long time (>5 sec) to
reload. The bomber seat can drop only Anti-Armor bombs and lacks the
cluster bombs of the Liberator. These bombs do almost double the damage
to armor as their liberator counterparts, but fall more slowly and are
released more slowly. This means it's more difficult to get enough bombs
on a heavily armored target to kill it before you pass over. The Vulture
has a higher top speed than the Liberator and has an afterburner. It can
also release bombs from a lower altitude than the Liberator.

## General Bombing Tactics

There are two generic bombing tactics that most pilots follow: Low
altitude bombing and high altitude bombing. Each has their advantages
and disadvantages as will be discussed.

### Low Altitude Bombing

I generally favor this tactic 90% of the time. I find it gets more kills
than high altitude most of the time and your survival rate is higher as
long as there is cover nearby.

For low altitude bombing you want to fly as low as possible to the
ground to avoid being seen by the enemy. You want to fly just high
enough as to not set off any [mines](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#High_Explosive_Mine)
on the ground. Approach your target from the flanks or rear. You only
want to take enemy fire on your exit and not your entrance. As you
approach, gain enough height so that the bombing icon is illuminated and
level out. After you pass the target (and hopefully destroyed it), dive
back down the previous altitude. Get to know each base terrain and plan
your flight path accordingly. Flying behind terrain and trees will break
lock-on weapons. Find a safe place to land, repair, and repeat the
process.

If you are doing low-altitude bombing, you generally do NOT need to take
a tailgunner with you. The tailgunner will have little to shoot at and
even if an enemy aircraft starts shooting at you, you will be so low to
the ground that the tailgunner will not be able to shoot up high enough
to hit the target. Know where friendly anti-air MAXes are and retreat to
them if you are under air attack.

### High Altitude Bombing

I personally rarely use this tactic, but in some cases it works better
than low-altitude. You will generally get less kills from higher
altitude as the enemy will see the bombs on their radar for many seconds
before impact and have plenty of time to run away. However, high
altitude exposes you to enemy fire for less periods of time generally as
they don't always see or notice you up there until you start dropping
bombs. I use this tactic when the enemy is clumped up on a bridge as
they have nowhere to run except to drown. I also use it if the enemy
base is at a low altitude and I'm fighting flak weapons ([Wall
Turrets](../items/Phalanx.md) and [TR](Terran_Republic.md)
[Burster](../items/Burster.md) [MAXes](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md). You're fairly
safe from [flak](../weapons/Flak.md) at high altitude unless you fly very
predictably and the enemy has great skill.

Again you will want to approach from the side or rear so that the enemy
isn't looking in your direction. Climb to maximum altitude ALWAYS. Never
bomb from a medium altitude as you are easily visible and have no place
to run or hide. I sometimes find it handy to place a personal waypoint
on the target as it's difficult to see the ground from high altitude.
After your bomber drops its bombs, turn sharply in some direction. This
will make it very difficult for flak to hit you. Change directions
randomly every 5 seconds or so if you're taking heavy flak fire and go
to the ground to repair. Never fly in a straight line away from flak
weapons. If you took little or no damage, feel free to turn around and
make another pass.

I highly recommend taking a tailgunner along for high altitude runs. You
will almost always attract enemy aircraft. Always fly at flight ceiling
so that the enemy cannot get above your tailgunner's line of fire. If
you are in the middle of nowhere and there is no threat from the ground,
STOP the aircraft, point the nose down as far as you can, and keep the
tail pointed towards the enemy aircraft by looking at your minimap. This
will generally close the distance between you and the enemy, making your
tailgunner land more shots and hopefully destroy it quicker. If you
don't do this, the aircraft will just stay at maximum distance and take
pot-shots at you all day until you die. Of course, if you know you are
near friendly anti-air units, you always have the option of running to
them as well.

### Lining up Targets

If you don't put the target under you bombardier's sights, you obviously
won't get any kills. This is your most important job. The most helpful
keymap you can make it to make the "reset controls" option (default
alt-r) to something easily accessible. I have it mapped to a mouse
button. If you want to make 100% sure you are level and your bombardier
can drop bombs, use this button liberally, as it will auto-level your
bomber. This is especially useful when you are coming out of a steep
turn or ascent.

Take note of the black vertical line in the pilot seat. This is the
bombing line. The bottom end of the line is what the bombardier's sites
will pass over. You can affect this line by strafing left and right. I
find strafing very useful. As you pass over a clump of infantry, strafe
left and right a little bit. This will spread your bombs out
perpendicular to your travel direction, giving your bomber much more
area to saturate in bombs and making it less likely that someone can
dodge your pass.

Generally, you want to avoid trying to bomb moving
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md). But you can always try. Make sure to
lead them enough. You will have to lead them much more than you think,
and your bombardier needs to understand how to do this too for a
successful kill.

You should be glancing at your mini-map every 2-3 seconds. If you fly
directly over an AMS, it will show on the radar, alerting you to make
another pass. The radar will also allow you to line targets up better
and know where enemy aircraft are.

### Standard Targets

Your bread and butter targets are generally ridges and base walls.
Ridges are routinely saturated with players if it overlooks a base,
providing cover for snipers and anti-vehicular users, and even armor.
This can yield many kills while always providing decent cover to run to
on the other side of the ridge.

The other great target are walls of bases. On the attack, the wall
facing the tower is the most populated if your empire owns the tower.
Line up the wall running down its length and lets the bombs fly on
unsuspecting snipers.

[Wall Turrets](../items/Phalanx.md) can be the most difficult of
targets to destroy. Many times your bombardier will overshoot the
target, making the bombs land past the target on the ground. To minimize
this risk, it's best to line up wall turrets so that you pass directly
over the stairs leading up to them (or the place where you might get in
for tower turrets). Placing bombs right on the stairs instead of trying
to put them directly on the turret will maximize your chances of
damaging or killing it. Make sure you tell your bomber this information
as well.

### Avoiding Enemy Fire

I've already talked about how to avoid flak fire. Never fly in a
straight line when taking flak fire and try to find some cover to break
the line of sight.

Against the [Sparrow](../items/Sparrow.md) MAX, you need to fly a little
differently. If you find Sparrow missiles following you, find terrain to
hide behind immediately. Even a small hole will do sometimes. Dip down
and STOP in the hole briefly. Wait until all the missiles have hit the
ground around you, then continue. If you hadn't stopped, you might have
avoided one or two missiles, but the rest would still have followed and
hit you.

Against a [Striker](../weapons/Striker.md) or
[Starfire](../items/Starfire.md) you can either find a tree or terrain to
break the lock, or simply fly out of its effective range (250m for the
striker, 350m for the Starfire). If you are flying directly away from
them at the same altitude, be sure to turn slightly as you reach the
maximum effective range, as the missiles will still follow their
previous path and may hit you if you don't change direction slightly.

Against a [Wasp](../vehicles/Wasp.md) and you are flying low, fly through
trees as much as possible to break the lock. Flying inside an [Aegis
Shield Generator](../weapons/Aegis_Shield_Generator.md) will also break the
lock, but you will likely give away its position, so use wisely. At
altitude, you have less options. Fly towards friendly anti-air units. If
you have a tailgunner, your best bet is to stop the aircraft and point
the tail to the wasp, as described earlier.

## Liberator or Vulture?

When you first get your shinny new Vulture, you will be tempted to use
it a lot. The sad truth is the Vulture is inferior to the Liberator in
almost every way, even though it is supposed to be an upgrade. While the
vulture bombs do more damage, they have a smaller splash radius, fall
slower, and release much slower. It also takes twice as long to reload a
clip.

I use the Liberator in almost all cases, however there are circumstances
in which the Vulture is actually the better choice. I use the vulture in
situations where anti-air cover is high and I want to fly low. With the
vulture, you can come in, drop some bombs, then afterburn away to
safety. You won't get as many kills with the Vulture, but you will live
more, so there is a trade-off that you will have to balance.

The tactics with the [Vulture](../vehicles/Vulture.md) is almost identical
to that of the Liberator. However, you generally want to avoid flying
high-altitude missions with the Vulture as it takes forever for the
bombs to reach the ground. The biggest difference is that you need to
slow down over a target to allow enough bombs to be dropped to kill it.
You can then quickly accelerate by afterburning away to safety. Due to
the small splash radius, you must really fly directly over the target. A
Vulture bomb will only kill a soldier wearing [Rexo](Rexo.md)
armor if it lands within 1-2 meters of him.

## Which Bombs to Use

This is obviously something the bombardier selects, but if he or she is
not picking the right bombs for the situation, you need to inform him.
The Vulture can only drop AV bombs, so there's no problem there. The
Liberator, however, can drop cluster bombs or tank buster bombs. The
cluster bombs spread out into 9 bomblets in a 3x3 grid pattern, while
the tank buster bombs simply drop to the ground with one big explosion.
Cluster bombs do less damage, but do the same full damage over a large
area. The tank buster bombs do more damage, but the damage falls off
over a relatively short distance away from the impact.

Use cluster bombs on large groups of infantry. It will take two bombs to
kill most infantry. Works best if you strafe as discussed before to
spread out the damage. The main use of cluster bombs are on
[BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md). Yes it sounds strange, but cluster bombs
actually do more damage to a BFR if its shields are up than a tank
buster bomb does. It also has a higher probability of damaging critical
systems. However, if the BFR has no shields, it's best to use tank
buster bombs.

Tank buster bombs should be used the majority of the time. It kills
infantry in one hit if reasonably close and does great damage to
vehicles. If you don't get anything else out of this guide, please USE
TANK BUSTER BOMBS ON MAX UNITS! It takes two tank buster bombs to kill a
MAX while taking 8 cluster bombs. Nothing annoys me more than my bomber
dropping cluster bombs on an anti-air MAX only for it to live and shoot
us down after we pass. These bombs should also be used in proximity to
doors as the splash damage will kill enemies inside the door while
cluster bombs will not. Also use tank buster bombs in heavily forested
areas as cluster bombs will sometimes explode at tree top level,
rendering them useless. Of course, tank buster bombs should be used on
all forms of vehicles, except [BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md), as discussed
earlier.

## Bombardier Information

Drop bombs on the enemy right? Well it's not always that simple.
Dropping all 10 bombs on the first target you see and then having to
reload when you pass over a cluster of 15 troops will make you and the
pilot mad. Always look as far forward as possible to spot highly
concentrated targets and save the majority of your bombs for that if you
don't think you can reload in time. And as I've already mentioned, use
tank buster bombs on MAXes!

Not every bombardier realizes that you can aim your bombs a little. By
moving your mouse up and down you can change the location of the
crosshair and that's where the bombs will land. In level flight at full
throttle, you should be able to land all 10 bombs on a single point.

When bombing targets at the top of a hill, aim a little on the downslope
closest to you to ensure you will hit it. It's embarrassing to watch all
10 bombs fly over the vanguard you were targeting and go down the
mountain, missing completely. The crosshair is accurate most of the
time, but don't always trust it, especially on steep slopes.
