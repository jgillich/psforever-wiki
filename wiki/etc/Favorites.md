All [Equipment Terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md), [Landing
Pads](../items/Landing_Pad.md) and [Repair/Rearm.md
Silos](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md) allow the current infantry or
vehicle [loadout](../terminology/Loadout.md) to be stored in one of a number of
presets.

Held in the 'Favorites' tab of the terminal interface, these allow the
soldier to instantly equip himself with a previously chosen setup, and
get straight back to business. There are ten slots available for
different infantry [loadouts](../terminology/Loadout.md) at the Equipment
terminal.

Favorites cannot store looted enemy-specific equipment (Use a
[Locker](../items/Lockers.md) for these). [Ancient
Technology](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) weapons can be stored as a
favorite, but the actual weapon will not be equipped unless the facility
has an [Equipment Module](../items/Equipment_Module.md) or you are in the
[caverns](../locations/Caverns.md). Note that AT Ammo will always be equipped.

Likewise, a vehicle's [Trunk](../terminology/Trunk.md) contents can be
similarly saved and recalled as needed. The [Landing
Pad](../items/Landing_Pad.md) and [Repair/Rearm.md
Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md) share a bank of five preset slots.

It is a good idea to prepare at least one of these infantry slots in
advance of major battles, as physical access to the Equipment terminal
of an [Advanced Mobile Station](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) can
be very limited if lots of people are trying to get equiped at once.

(Note: The Vehicle Slots will store anything currently in the trunk, not
just ammunition for that vehicle. This is particularly useful for
unarmed vehicles, such as the [Wraith](../vehicles/Wraith.md) or
[Lodestar](../vehicles/Lodestar.md). By taking time to manually load these
trunks beforehand in [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md), the exact
contents can be replicated at will in the field. e.g. a trunk full of
[Adaptive Construction Engines](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md)
as a Wraith favorite.)
