![](images/TeamSpeak.jpg "fig:TeamSpeak.jpg") [Teamspeak](Teamspeak.md)
is a voice communications program. It is often used for online first
person shooters to communicate with players on the same team as you,
usually through use of a headset or microphone. By using Teamspeak,
players avoid the hassle of having to type out messages, and can simply
voice what they want to say which saves time.

To be able to use TeamSpeak, the user has to download the client and the
connect to a TeamSpeak server. Usually, a player will log into a
TeamSpeak server before running the game that they wish to play.
TeamSpeak has become very popular with
[PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md), and many
[outfits](../terminology/Outfit.md) use Teamspeak as their main method of
communication in game, going as far as to mandate Teamspeak to be a part
of the [outfit](../terminology/Outfit.md). However, not all
[outfits](../terminology/Outfit.md) require a microphone or a headset, as it is
often useful for players to simply listen to the other players on their
team.
