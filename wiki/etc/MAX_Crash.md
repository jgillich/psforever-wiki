![ crash forms up in a
[Tower](../locations/Towers.md)](../images/Max_Crash.jpg){ class="figure" } The MAX Crash is an armored-infantry-based
rapid-ingress assault tactic.

A large group of soldiers wearing [MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md)
suits charges a [Facility](../locations/Facilities.md), usually the
[Back Door](../locations/Back_Door.md), and attempts to breach defenses in
Auto-run mode.

Usually this requires a significant group, as the MAXes are unable to open
locked [IFF](../terminology/IFF.md) panels or fire their weapons in auto-run
mode.
