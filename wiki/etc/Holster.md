Holsters are [inventory](../terminology/Inventory.md) slots that allow stored
weapons to be carried for immediate use. Holsters come in two sizes: Pistol and
Rifle.

A Pistol holster is 3x3. A Rifle holster is 3x9.

Holstered items in the pistol slots appear on the thighs. Items in the rifle
holsters appear on the player's back. Each armor type has a different
configuration of holsters.

- [Infiltration Suits](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md) have only one pistol
  holster.
- [Standard Exo-Suits](../armor/Standard_Exo-Suit.md) have one pistol holster
  and one rifle holster.
- [Agile Exo-Suits](../armor/Agile_Exo-Suit.md) have two pistol holsters and one
  rifle holster, as well as more inventory space than Standard.
- [Reinforced Exo-Suits](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) have two pistol
  holsters and two rifle holsters.

To equip a holster, simply click and drag the item into the slot. You can also
Right-click on an item already in a holster to quickly swap it out with a
similar-sized item in your backpack space, such as swapping out an
[REK](../weapons/Remote_Electronics_Kit.md) for a
[BANK](../weapons/Body_Armor_Nano_Kit.md) in the pistol holster.

Switching between holstered items requires that the first item being held be put
away first, followed by the unholstering of the second item. This is done by
pressing the correspoinding number for each holster:

1 - Left pistol slot 2 - Left rifle slot 3 - Right pistol slot 4 - Right rifle
slot 5 - Melee weapon slot (Unchangeable) These extra holsters and inventory
space come at a price in foot-speed. The greater you can carry, the slower you
run or walk.
