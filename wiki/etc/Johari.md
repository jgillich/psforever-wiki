**Johari** was the second of two west-coast based servers (with
[Markov](Markov.md) remaining, but now merged into [Gemini](Gemini.md)). Johari
was shut down and its characters moved to Markov to increase falling populations
on both servers. These characters are now on the Gemini server. Character and
outfit names with a "-J" on the end were names that already existed on Markov,
and can still be seen on the Gemini server.
