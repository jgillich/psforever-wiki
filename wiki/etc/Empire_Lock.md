An Empire Lock is when all available slots for a given
[Empire](../terminology/Empire.md) on a specific
[Planet](../locations/Planet.md) are in use.

Each Empire is currently allowed roughly 133 troops per continent, or 13 full
[squads](../terminology/Squad.md).

Empire Lock status can be viewed from the
[Interstellar Map](../terminology/Interstellar_Map.md) as a padlock symbol on
one of the side windows.
