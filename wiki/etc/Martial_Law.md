The **Martial Law** (or **Marshal Law**) is an April Fool's Day inspired
event that took place from April 1, 2006 through April 7, 2006.

## Announcement

The war for control over the Auraxis warpgate system continues to move
forward. The reserve forces that each empire has put out a call for are
quickly making their way into the sanctuaries and into action.

The Core Scientist Council made up of scientists from the three
councils, has a different view on the situation at hand. The theory is
that when they breached the barriers, these reinforcements rode in on a
western wind stream that exposed the core to dangerous corrosion and
warped it backwards to unknown realms of technology.

Martial Law has been declared on the island of Desolation. As a lone
tumbleweed rolls across the terrain, soldiers continue the battle but
with limited and somewhat ancient resources.

After further research, the scientists have uncovered more about the
ancient technology.

- The only side arms available are 6 Shooters, Long Rifles, Single
