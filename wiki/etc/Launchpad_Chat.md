**THIS INFORMATION IS OUTDATED, THE LAUNCHPAD CHAT WAS REMOVED LONG
AGO.**

The Planetside Launchpad has a built in chat system with 7 chat rooms.

- [Emerald](Emerald.md)
- [Werner](Werner.md)
- [Markov](Markov.md)
- [New Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate.md)
- [Vanu Sovereignty](Vanu_Sovereignty.md)

- General

Clearly General chat is the one that most people go to upon opening
Chat. People often frequent the Emerald chat room as well.

The customer service staff are all moderators and thats who you usualy
find in the chat room. Usualy around the time of a playtest the producer
([Zatozia](Zatozia.md)) and sometimes a quality assurance team
member will arrive to talk to the players before the play test. Also
when major events happen on the servers members of the team can
sometimes be found here.
