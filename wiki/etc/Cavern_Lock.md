Cavern lock is granted to an empire when they completely control an active Core
[Cavern](../locations/Caverns.md) by having posession of all cavern
[Facilities](../locations/Facilities.md).

**Cavern lock [benefits](../terminology/Empire_Benefit.md)** grant all
[module benefits](Module_benefit.md) to any
[facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) linked to the cavern via a
[geowarp](../locations/Geowarp.md).

These benefits will remain until the cavern is either unlocked or becomes
inactive.
