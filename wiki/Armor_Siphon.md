**Armor Siphon**

The Armor Siphon is a [BFR](/BFR "wikilink") pilot weapon. Like the [NTU
Siphon](/NTU_Siphon "wikilink"), each empire has their own unique model
of the Armor Siphon, but they all function identically.

The Armor Siphon is a close range weapon effective only against vehicles
(not [MAXs](/MAX "wikilink") or infantry). The weapon bypasses any
shields the vehicle has and damages the vehicle. If your BFR is damaged,
the armor that you take off of the enemy is "siphoned" into your BFR and
repairs you. Note that status damages, such as sensor arrays will NOT be
repaired by the armor siphon. You must repair your BFR by other means to
fix damaged systems. The armor siphon does not use any ammo, but rather
uses a capacitor that recharges automatically when not in use. The
capacitor has enough energy to kill the equivalent of an
[ANT](/ANT "wikilink") in armor. More heavily armored targets will
require a brief recharge.

[Jammer Grenades](/Jammer_Grenade "wikilink") and [EMP](/EMP "wikilink")
blasts will disable the armor siphon completely for a short time (unlike
traditional BFR weapons that simply receive rate of fire penalties).

The best (and almost the only practical) use of this weapon is in
conjuction with the [NTU Siphon](/NTU_Siphon "wikilink") in attacking
enemy [BFRs](/BFR "wikilink"). By using the NTU Siphon to
[EMP](/EMP "wikilink") the enemy, then using the Armor Siphon to bypass
their shields, the enemy BFR can be destroyed fairly quickly.
