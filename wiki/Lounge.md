![](images/TRLounge.jpg "fig:TRLounge.jpg") Lounge\]\] Sometimes called the
Kitchen, this room is typically adjacent to the [respawn
room](respawn_room.md) in a [facility](facilities.md).

The lounge contains a dining table, food storage unit, a sink, cabinets,
sofa, entertainment center, and a holographic tactical situation table.

Stairs lead down from this room to the [Barracks](Barracks.md)
below and from there to the basement.

It should be noted that [Bio Laboratories](Bio_Laboratory.md) do
not have lounges or barracks. Instead they have a special research area
with [lockers](lockers.md) and a [Medical
Terminal](Medical_Terminal.md). Stairs lead down from this lab
to a creepy storage facility where players will find the bodies of those
who have offended the Planetside Developers and are hung suspended in a
viscous fluid, floating lifelessly until game world ends.
