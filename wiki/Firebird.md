[thumb](image:Firebird.md.jpg) The Firebird is the only weapon
on the [New Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate.md)'s [Assault
Buggy](Assault_Buggy.md), the [Enforcer](Enforcer.md).

The Firebird is mounted to an open turret and controlled by a single
soldier. Rockets are fed from the trunk of the Enforcer.

The rockets are straight-firing unguided projectiles, equally dangerous
to infantry and vehicles.
