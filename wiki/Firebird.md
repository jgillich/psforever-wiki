[thumb](image:Firebird.jpg "wikilink") The Firebird is the only weapon
on the [New Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate "wikilink")'s [Assault
Buggy](Assault_Buggy "wikilink"), the [Enforcer](Enforcer "wikilink").

The Firebird is mounted to an open turret and controlled by a single
soldier. Rockets are fed from the trunk of the Enforcer.

The rockets are straight-firing unguided projectiles, equally dangerous
to infantry and vehicles.
