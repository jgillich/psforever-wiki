**Adaptive Construction Engine (ACE)**

**NOTOC**

Key to setting up defenses and used for special operations, the
**Adaptive Construction Engine** is a multi-purpose device used in the
construction of defensive perimeters. A single-use device, the ACE can
be deployed as seven different items by adjusting the firemode
selection.

All deployed ACE and [FDU](FDU.md "wikilink") devices that you own will
show as a different color in the gameworld and the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink"). The default color is yellow. Each
device can also be deconstructed by double clicking the deployable icon
on the continental map and selecting to deconstruct it.

'''NOTE: The [Shadow Turret](Shadow_Turret.md "wikilink"), [Cerberus
Turret](Cerberus_Turret.md "wikilink"), [Sensor
Disruptor](Sensor_Disruptor.md "wikilink"), and [Disruptor
Mine](Disruptor_Mine.md "wikilink") require additional
[certifications](certification.md "wikilink"), and cannot be used with
merely the [Combat Engineering](Combat_Engineering.md "wikilink")
certification.

The options are:

## Remote-Detonated Charge (Boomer)

Commonly referred to as a "Boomer", the 1st mode available on the ACE
allows for the construction of this deadly remote detonated charge.
Originally intended to be used as a perimeter control device,
[Cloakers](Infiltration_Suit.md "wikilink") and other enterprising
induviduals have adapted them to be used as offensive weapons,
particularly useful for destroying [generators](generator.md "wikilink")
and [Respawn tubes](Respawn_tube.md "wikilink"). Boomers can be attached to
almost any static surface, indoors or out, and as long as the trigger
remains intact, will remain in position, ready to be detonated. Boomers
can be detonated by [Jammer grenades](Jammer_grenade.md "wikilink") and
[EMPs](EMP.md "wikilink"). Friendly Boomers are indicated by a green ring
surrounding the deployed Boomer, and will not detonate to friendly
jammers/EMPs. Up to 20 Boomers may be deployed by a single Combat
Engineer at any one time.

## High Explosive Mine

![](images/HE*Mine.jpg "fig:HE_Mine.jpg") The enemy of many a soldier, this
proximity mine fortunately can tell friend from foe, but that's about
it. Lay and pray is the motto to follow after deploying this devestating
weapon. Harmful to both infantry and [vehicle](vehicle.md "wikilink")
alike, the weapons litter the battlefields. While not as versatile as
[Boomers](ACE.md#Boomer "wikilink") (they cannot be deployed indoors and
cannot be remotely detonated), they make up for it in sheer force.
Susceptible to standard fire, Jammers and [EMP](EMP.md "wikilink") blasts,
the weapons are easily enough destroyed. Like
[Boomers](<#Remote-Detonated_Charge*(Boomer)> "wikilink"), friendly Mines
will display a green ring surrounding them and cannot be detonated by
other friendly Jammers/[EMPs](EMP.md "wikilink"). Up to 20 Mines may be
deployed by a single Combat Engineer at any one time.

## Spitfire Turret

![](images/Spitfire.jpg "fig:Spitfire.jpg")\]\] The bane of many a soldier,
this deployable turret is a common sight on the battlefield. Set to
automatically fire at any adversary (soldier or
[vehicle](vehicle.md "wikilink")), the "Spit" is a dangerous battlefield
obstacle. [EMPs](EMP.md "wikilink") and [Jammer
grenades](Jammer_grenade.md "wikilink") will disable them for a short
period of time. Other methods of bypassing them include walking (default
by holding left shift) and crouch walking (This DOES NOT work when the
Spitfire Turret is inside a [Facility](Facility.md "wikilink")
[SOI](SOI.md "wikilink") that has the
[Interlink](Interlink_Facility.md "wikilink") Benefit), or using [Sensor
Shield](Sensor_Shield.md "wikilink"). Be aware however, using a weapon or
taking damage (ie from falling) will reveal your presence to the
spitfire regardless of sensor shield or crouch walking, and it will fire
upon you anyway. The detection and firing range of the Spitfire Turret
is 50 m. Up to 10 Spitfire Turrets can be deployed by a single Combat
Engineer at any one time.

Be Forewarned, standing near a friendly Spitfire can cause your death as
this remote weapons platform will not only shoot straight at friendly
soldiers standing between them and any enemies it can see, but can also
be destroyed by snipers with only two shots. When destroyed the Spitfire
creates a large explosion capable of killing all infantry in close
vicinity as well as damaging [Vehicles](Vehicle.md "wikilink").

Players trained in the art [Data Corruption](Data_Corruption.md "wikilink")
can corrupt the programming of enemy Spitfire Turrets with their
[T-REK](T.$1.md "wikilink"), causing them to shoot at friendlies, rather
than enemies. The only way to find out if a Spitfire has been infected,
is to walk into its line of fire, and see if it shoots you. This,
however, is not recommended.

## Motion Sensor Alarm

The sensor net integrated into the facilities is quite advanced,
however, the range is limited. By utilizing deployable motion sensors,
the sensor net can be extended. In addition, motion sensors can detect
cloaked and radar-supressive units. This can be counteracted by the
[Sensor Shield](Sensor_Shield.md "wikilink")
[Implant](Implants.md "wikilink"). Motion sensors can be disrupted using
[Jammer grenades](Jammer_grenade.md "wikilink") and Command
[EMPs](EMP.md "wikilink"), however these will not destroy them. Up to 20
Motion Sensors can be deployed by a single Combat Engineer at any one
time.

If certed in [Expert Hacking](Expert_Hacking.md "wikilink"), a player can
use their [T-REK](T.$1.md "wikilink") to alter the programming of an enemy
Motion Sensor, causing it to display all friendlies as enemies on radar.
The next time you want to boomer that red dot coming around the corner,
you better make sure it's really an enemy!
