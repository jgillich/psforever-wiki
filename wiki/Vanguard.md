**Vanguard**

The Vanguard is the [New Conglomerate](/New_Conglomerate "wikilink")'s
[Medium Battle Tank](/Medium_Battle_Tank "wikilink"). It has a low side
profile and is the most heavily armored MBT. Its gunner can switch
between two guns. Its main gun does a lot of damage but fires slowly.
This makes it hard to engage moving targets and important that the first
shot is a hit. The secondary gun is dual 20mm cannons that is useful
against aircraft or targets at large distances.

The Vanguard requires a [Technology Plant](/Technology_Plant "wikilink")
lattice link or [Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink") vehicle pad in order
to be purchasable.

Shots to kill (with 150mm Cannon only):

|                                    |          |
| ---------------------------------- | -------- |
| [Lightning](/Lightning "wikilink") | 4 shots  |
| [Prowler](/Prowler "wikilink")     | 10 shots |
| [Magrider](/Magrider "wikilink")   | 8 shots  |
