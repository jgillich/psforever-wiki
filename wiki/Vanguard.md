**Vanguard**

The Vanguard is the [New Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate.md)'s
[Medium Battle Tank](Medium_Battle_Tank.md). It has a low side
profile and is the most heavily armored MBT. Its gunner can switch
between two guns. Its main gun does a lot of damage but fires slowly.
This makes it hard to engage moving targets and important that the first
shot is a hit. The secondary gun is dual 20mm cannons that is useful
against aircraft or targets at large distances.

The Vanguard requires a [Technology Plant](Technology_Plant.md)
lattice link or [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md) vehicle pad in order
to be purchasable.

Shots to kill (with 150mm Cannon only):

|                                      |          |
| ------------------------------------ | -------- |
| [Lightning](Lightning.md) | 4 shots  |
| [Prowler](Prowler.md)     | 10 shots |
| [Magrider](Magrider.md)   | 8 shots  |
