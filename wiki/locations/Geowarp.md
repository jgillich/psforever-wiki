Geowarps are similar to [warpgate](Warpgate.md)'s ability to
transport you from planet to planet, but geowarps teleport you to the
[Caverns](Caverns.md). A player may
[broadcast](../terminology/Broadcast.md) to these gates just as they can a
warpgate. Teleporting directly into the caves from a warpgate is not
possible, however. When broadcasting from a warpgate to a geowarp you
must first exit the warp bubble, then re-enter it and travel through the
central beam to teleport to the linked cavern.

Every planet possesses two [Geowarps](Geowarp.md) (except for
the [Oshur](Oshur.md) [Battle
Islands](Battle_Islands.md), which only contain one
[Geowarp](Geowarp.md) located on [Nexus](Nexus.md), but
it is presently always inactive), and two [caverns](Caverns.md)
are open at any time, meaning that 11 [geowarps](Geowarp.md)
will be inactive at any given time (2 caverns x 4 geowarps per cavern -
9 planets x 2 [geowarps](Geowarp.md) per planet + 1 geowarp on
[Nexus](Nexus.md) = 11 inactive [geowarps](Geowarp.md)).

However, the programming intentionally makes it so that all the
"[Neutral](../terminology/Neutral_Continent.md)" continents are always linked
to a cave by a geowarp, even when the caves rotate. This means that one
[Home Continent](Home_Continent.md) of one
[empire](../terminology/Empire.md) will not have an active cavern link at any
give time.

Geowarps are the means by which [Cavern Locks](../etc/Cavern_Lock.md)
link to facilities to provide [Module
benefits](../etc/Module_benefit.md).
