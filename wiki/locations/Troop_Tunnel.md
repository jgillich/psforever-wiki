Troop Tunnels are narrow passageways in [Caverns](Caverns.md)
connecting the larger access tunnels to the main chamber. They normally
have [ziplines](../items/Zipline.md) at various points and can serve as a
flanking route in combat.

While meant for infantry, small vehicles and aircraft can also traverse
these tunnels, though they will take damage from contacting the
ziplines.
