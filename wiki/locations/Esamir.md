## Description

One of two 'white' [continents](Continent.md), **Esamir** is
currently the largest planet/continent being fought over in the Auraxian
Civil War.

According to game lore, Esamir was the last continent to be mapped by
the [Terran Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md) after traveling
through the Wormhole. While the entire continent is blanketed in snow,
the temperature is not cold enough to freeze the lagoon that encompasses
the central island. The planet shivers beneath a sky full of moons.

Esamir's warpgates have a history of being very unstable, partly due to
the high concentration of matrixing echoes present. Many weapon and
vehicle patterns (most notably the [Lasher](../weapons/Lasher.md)) were
retrived from the warpgates on Esamir.

The continent's terrain is rough, scattered with dense snow-covered
forests, low visibility and rolling hills, making off-road travel via
ground vehicles difficult. This snowy, challenging terrain can be
bewildering to learn, but judicious use of your personal waypoint will
keep you on the right path.

Esamir is a [Home Continent](Home_Continent.md). Thirteen bases
are located here, with the [Capitol](Capitol.md),
[Eisa](../facilities/Eisa.md) located on a frozen island in the central sea,
surrounded by its [Sub-Capitols](Sub-Capitol.md).

A [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md) warpgate links to the
[Helheim](../facilities/Helheim.md) [Technology
Plant](Technology_Plant.md) in the south east. The continent's
other [Warpgates](Warpgate.md) link from [Ran](../facilities/Ran.md)
to [Marduk](../facilities/Marduk.md), [Ishundar](Ishundar.md);
[Nott](../facilities/Nott.md) to [Leza](../facilities/Leza.md),
[Cyssor](Cyssor.md); and [Andvari](../facilities/Andvari.md) to
[Dagda](../facilities/Dagda.md), [Forseral](Forseral.md). See [Home
Continent](Home_Continent.md) for the current empire sanctuary
links.

This continent is also refered to as
[Es](../terminology/Acronyms_and_Slang.md#Es).

Esamir has two distinct land bridge areas; paths where vehicles can ford
bodies of water with little risk of engine swamping.
