## Description

Heavy clouds hang in the atmosphere here and the oxygen levels are low, although
the air is dense with other elements. (Troops regularly activate their
bio-containment fields when operating on Hossin.)

This lush, temperate continent has low-lying hills and boggy swamps dotting the
terrain that lure the unwary into thinking straight-line of travel would be
easiest, much to their later dismay.

The [continent](Continent.md) is divided by a river in the center which splits
and surrounds an island on its way through the continent. On this island is the
[Capitol](Capitol.md) of Hossin, [Voltan](../facilities/Voltan.md), an
[Interlink Facility](Interlink.md).

Hossin is a [Home Continent](Home_Continent.md). A [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md)
warpgate links to the [Mulac](../facilities/Mulac.md) Technology Plant in the
south east. The continent's other [warpgates](Warpgate.md) link from
[Ghanon](../facilities/Ghanon.md) to [Sungrey](../facilities/Sungrey.md) on
[Amerish](Amerish.md), [Hurakan](../facilities/Hurakan.md) to
[Wakea](../facilities/Wakea.md) on [Searhus](Searhus.md), and
[Chac](../facilities/Chac.md) to [Baal](../facilities/Baal.md) on
[Ishundar](Ishundar.md). See [Home Continent](Home_Continent.md) for the current
empire sanctuary links.

This continent is also refered to as
[Hos](../terminology/Acronyms_and_Slang.md).
