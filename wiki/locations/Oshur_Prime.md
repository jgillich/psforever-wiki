## [Oshur Prime](Oshur_Prime.md)

The name Oshur once belonged to an extremely rough desert continent consisting
of the broken bones of an impact crater. The rough badlands and choppy terrain
made it relatively easy to hide fairly large forces in what seemed to be plain
view. A giant, unexplained avian skeleton lay fossilized on the continent,
giving rise to lively discussions about the
[Ancient Vanu](../terminology/Ancients.md) that were there before.

This single-mass continent is now most commonly referred to as
"[Oshur Prime](Oshur_Prime.md)."

## [The Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md): [Battle Islands](Battle_Islands.md)

When [The Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md) occurred, ripping apart our reality
and spreading the [Auraxian](Auraxis.md) continents across a dozen worlds, Oshur
was erased or torn asunder. In its place appeared 4 smaller landmasses we now
call "The [Battle Islands](Battle_Islands.md)."

## Technical Note

Oshur Prime still exists as a server cluster, however it is not normally
accessible on the "live" servers. Occasionally Oshur will be opened up on the
live server for fighting by a GM, made accessible via
[Instant Action](../terminology/Instant_Action.md). The battles last until every
base runs out of [NTU](../items/NTU.md) as there are no active
[warpgates](Warpgate.md) for resupply.

## Future of Oshur Prime

[Official Forums](http://psforums.station.sony.com/ps/board/message?board.id=psdiscussion&message.id=691905#M691905):

"When we mentioned bringing Oshur back in the past, it was still in the idea
phase. We are still planning on bringing back old Oshur but we have not set an
exact date of when it will return though. We are currently working on features
being put into version 3.9 release. We hope to work the plans for returning
Oshur after 3.9 has been completed and pushed live. We will keep you updated on
it when we can."

On 08 Aug 2006, Outfit Wars were announced, with Oshur Prime
as their theatre of operations.
