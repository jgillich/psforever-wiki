## Description

The [planet](Planet.md) that Cyssor is on may not last more than a few more
decades. Its sun is unstable and is on the verge of tearing itself apart,
exploding outward and destroying its solar system. Already the skies burn with
the extra radiation and flares that beat against the upper atmosphere.

The planet itself occationally tremors and shakes against the coming storm, but
is generally still stable. In ages past, these quakes shook this continent until
it broke and the pieces that remain look more like islands than an intact
continent.

Bridges span the many waterways on this island [continent](Continent.md) and it
still has the tallest mountain on the planet. Commanders will recognize the many
traffic flow bottlenecks and the centrally located
[Dropship Center](Dropship_Center.md) in the middle of Cyssor.

[Continent Locking](Continent_lock.md) Cyssor grants a +10% armor bonus to all
vehicles of given empire.
