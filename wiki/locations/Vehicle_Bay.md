Only
[Technology Plants](../locations/Technology_Plant.md) feature **Vehicle Bays**.
The Vehicle Bay is in the basement, and is a large room with a
[Vehicle Terminal](../locations/Vehicle_Terminal.md). Only
[Ground Vehicles](:category:Ground_Vehicles) can be purchased there.

Once a [vehicle](../vehicles/index.md) is created it is
[auto-driven](../terminology/Auto-drive.md) through a tunnel into the
[Courtyard](Courtyard.md).

There are 4 doors that lead to the Vehicle Bay: 2 that lead to the main
staircase area, 1 that leads to the [Back Door](Back_Door.md) area, and the
Vehicle Bay outer doors.
