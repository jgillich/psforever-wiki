## Description

![](../images/Techplant.jpg "fig:Techplant.jpg") Technology Plants are arguably
the most important type of [facility](Facilities.md) on a continent, as its
[base benefit](../terminology/Facility_Linked_Benefit.md) allows acquisition of
[Advanced Assault vehicles and aircraft](../vehicles/Advanced_Assault_vehicles.md).
Any facility linked to this base along a lattice will receive this powerful
benefit. Without it, Empires must purchase advanced vehicles from their
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md).

The [Control Console](Control_Console.md) for this base is on the top floor,
while the [LLU](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) Socket is located on Level
1 in the basement.

Another unique feature of Tech Plants, as they are called, is the
[Vehicle Terminals](Vehicle_Terminal.md) are located indoors. On the top floor
are two terminals for the Air Vehicle creation pads, and another on Level 2 for
the Ground Vehicle creation pad.
