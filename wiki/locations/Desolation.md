## Topography

The sand dunes that stretch across most of the island provide enough cover for
vehiles to go "hull down" against, and for infantry to use as LOS blocks. Squads
of infantry and vehicles will do best here when coordinated as groups.
Stragglers that try to cross the dunes alone are ripe for snipers and air
cavalry.

## Limitations

As is the case with all [Battle Islands](Battle_Islands.md), heavy weapons and
vehicles do not operate here. Not permitted are
[Heavy Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) weapons,
[Reavers](../vehicles/Reaver.md), [Artillery](../terminology/Artillery.md),
[BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md),
[Medium Battle Tanks](../items/Medium_Battle_Tank.md), and Empire Specific
[Deliverer](../vehicles/Deliverer.md) variants.

## [Facilities](Facilities.md)

All three bases on this island are
[LLU](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md)-capture
[Technology Plants](../locations/Technology_Plant.md). The lack of a
[Bio Laboratory](Bio_Laboratory.md) here means that spawn times are not modified
by anything but [Modules](../modules/index.md).

### [Technology Plants](../locations/Technology_Plant.md)

- [Dahaka](../facilities/Dahaka.md)
- [Izha](../facilities/Izha.md)
- [Jamshid](../facilities/Jamshid.md)
