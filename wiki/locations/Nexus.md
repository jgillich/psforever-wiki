A hill perimeter surrounds the only facility, [Atar](../facilities/Atar.md), a
[Dropship Center](Dropship_Center.md), linked by two [Warpgates](Warpgate.md)
and a [Geowarp](Geowarp.md).

This critical island lynchpin connects [Extinction](Extinction.md) to
[Ascension](Ascension.md), while having no connections at all to other planets.
The connected [Geowarp](Geowarp.md) is always inactive and never connects to a
[Cavern](Caverns.md) at the present time.

[Towers](Towers.md) on the hill rim can only be accessed from footpaths on the
outside of the hills, so be aware that they are different challenges to attack
and defend.

Foot trails (not wide enough for vehicles) will often take you to interesting
objectives around the map. Look for foot trails from the warpgates that lead you
to these hidden paths.

As is the case with all [Battle Islands](Battle_Islands.md), heavy weapons and
vehicles do not operate here. Not permitted are
[Heavy Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) weapons,
[Reavers](../vehicles/Reaver.md), [Artillery](../terminology/Artillery.md),
[BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md),
[Medium Battle Tanks](../items/Medium_Battle_Tank.md), and Empire Specific
[Deliverer](../vehicles/Deliverer.md) variants.
