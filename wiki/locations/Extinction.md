## Terrain

Although bridge battles are common on this island, water-based attacks are
possible via hover ([AT](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) or
[VS](../terminology/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) vehicles and
[Deliverer](../vehicles/Deliverer.md) variants. Shoreline access is possible at
many strategic points on this map if bridge battles are blocking progress
elsewhere.

## Limitations

As is the case with all [Battle Islands](Battle_Islands.md), heavy weapons and
vehicles do not operate here. Not permitted are
[Heavy Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) weapons,
[Reavers](../vehicles/Reaver.md), [Artillery](../terminology/Artillery.md),
[BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md),
[Medium Battle Tanks](../items/Medium_Battle_Tank.md), and Empire Specific
[Deliverer](../vehicles/Deliverer.md) variants.

## Geology

Long ago, geological stresses erupted here, pushing up through the sea floor and
creating a volcano that spewed lava for a time before dying. When a great quake
rumbled through this area mere decades ago, a new smaller volcano was born
amidst the ruins of the old crater.

Now, laval islands have been cut by wind, water, and steady erosion. The volcano
is dormant for now, but who knows how long that will last.
