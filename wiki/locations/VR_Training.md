# VR Training

![in [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md)](../images/VR_bldg.jpg){ class="figure" }

The VR Training area can be found in
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md), in the same building as the spawn tubes.
The area is divided in to two sections; the Shooting Range and Driving Area.

## Shooting Range

The Shooting Range contains a set of
[Equipment terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) and a large area populated
with holographic enemy infantry, MAX Units and light vehicles.

While in the Shooting Range, all
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md) restrictions are lifted,
allowing any soldier to use any of their own Empire's available equipment. (The
exception to this is the
[Command Uplink Device](../weapons/Command_Uplink_Device.md), which still
requires [Command Rank](../terminology/Command_Rank.md) 2 or more to
requisition.)

Even though the holographic targets are largely stationary, this still provides
a useful place to experiment with the various weapons in a calm and controlled
setting.

It is not possible to experiment with an enemy empire's specific equipment here.

[Favorites](../terminology/Favorites.md) may be saved here, just as at any other
Equipment Terminal. To leave the Shooting Range, enter the Teleport column in
the centre of the room.

## Driving Range

The Driving Area consists of a small holographic
[continent](../locations/Continent.md) with similar features to one of the real
temperate planets, such as [Cyssor](Cyssor.md) or [Amerish](Amerish.md). It is
dotted with [Vehicle Terminals](../locations/Vehicle_Terminal.md), a
[BFR Shed](../items/BFR_Shed.md) and a
[Dropship Terminal](Dropship_Terminal.md), located across the bridge to the east
of the start point. This island provides an excellent opportunity to gain a feel
for the handling characteristics of any of the available vehicles, and their
guns.

As with the Shooting Range, certification restrictions are lifted for the
duration of the soldier's session here, allowing any of their Empire's vehicles
to be selected and tested. Unfortunately, there are no targets in this area to
practice vehicle gunnery on, apart from trees and rocks.

While not normally available, enemy empire-specific vehicles can be acquired
here if your empire has [locked](../terminology/Continental_lock.md) both
[Home Continents](Home_Continent.md) of an enemy empire, or has gained enemy
vehicles through an event.

There is a [Repair Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md) located next to the
starting vehicle terminal, allowing Favorites to be saved, and BFR weapons to be
changed. To exit the Driving Area, exit any vehicle, and walk into one of the
columns dotted about the map.

Once VR Training is exited, normal certification restrictions apply.

(Note: This area is especially important for new recruits, as experimenting with
each weapon and vehicle will grant bonus
[Experience Points](../terminology/Experience_Points.md), and it is quite easy
to attain [Battle Rank](../terminology/Battle_Rank.md) four in VR Training
alone. This means you start active duty with ten
[Certification points](../certifications/Certification_points.md) to spend,
instead of seven.)
