![](../images/BioLabResearchRoom.jpg){ class="figure" } The
Research Room can only be found in [Bio Laboratories](Bio_Laboratory.md) behind
the [Spawn Room](Spawn_Room.md).

The Research Area right behind the Spawn Room features a
[Medical Terminal](../items/Medical_Terminal.md) and several
[Lockers](../items/Lockers.md).

Down the stairs is the main Research Area with special Tubes with people in them
as well as some boxes. If the Bio Laboratory is a
[LLU](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) [Facility](Facilities.md) than the
[Lattice Logic Unit Socket](Lattice_Logic_Unit_Socket.md) will also be in this
Room.
