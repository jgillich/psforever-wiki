## Description

A distant yellow sun does little to warm this permafrost planet.

Extremely tall cliffs create chasms and blocks that challenge the
tactical mind of any Commander. Cliffs abound and a misplaced footstep
can send you hurtling to your doom. Air vehicles can cross terrain
quickly, but foot soldiers and ground vehicles find that many miles lay
between point A and point B due to successive switchbacks and roundabout
roads crawling up the vertical cliffsides.

The central plateau that houses the capitol,
[Anguta](../facilities/Anguta.md), and two of its sub-capitols rises high
above the rest of the continent.

Ceryshen is a [Home Continent](Home_Continent.md). See [Home
Continent](Home_Continent.md) for the current empire
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md) links.

This continent is also refered to as
[Cery](../terminology/Acronyms_and_Slang.md).
