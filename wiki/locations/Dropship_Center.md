## Description

![](../images/Dropship.jpg "Dropship.jpg")

**Dropship Centers** are some of the rarest and most powerful
[bases](Facilities.md) on a [planet](Planet.md). There
is only a single **Dropship Center** on each planet yet their benefit
can free up an army of [Engineers](../certifications/Engineering.md). The
**Dropship Center** gives all friendly-linked
[facilities](Facilities.md) the ability to repair any
non-[Ancient Tech](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) ground or air
[vehicle](category:_Vehicles.md) through the use of the ground
vehicle [Repair/Rearm Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md) and air
vehicle [Repair/Rearm.md Landing Pad](../items/Landing_Pad.md) (ancient tech
vehicles require a [Vehicle Module](../etc/Vehicle_Module.md) for this
function). The **Dropship Center** is also the largest of all
[facilities](Facilities.md) and the only location (other than
your [sanctuary](Sanctuary.md)) capable of spawning the gigantic
[Galaxy](../vehicles/Galaxy.md), [Galaxy
Gunship](../vehicles/Galaxy_Gunship.md), and [Lodestar](../vehicles/Lodestar.md)
aircraft. The dropship air vehicle pad is located within its own
building in the **Dropship Center's** courtyard.
