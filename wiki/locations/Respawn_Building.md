![](../images/Respawn.jpg){ class="figure" } At each
[Sanctuary Villa](Sanctuary_Villa.md) are three
[Respawn Buildings](Respawn_Building.md) placed close to the
[HART building](HART_building.md). These locations are where any player spawns
upon entering Sanctuary; from character creation, via
[Recall](../terminology/Recall.md), exiting [VR Training](VR_Training.md), or the
unlikely event of death while still in Sanctuary.

Inside each building are 6 [Respawn tubes](../items/Respawn_Tube.md) and several
[Equipment terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md). Along the side of each
building are also doors leading to the [VR Training](VR_Training.md) rooms. Most
other Sanctuary services can be found in the nearby
[HART building](HART_building.md).
