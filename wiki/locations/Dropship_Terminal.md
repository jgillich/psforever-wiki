# Dropship Terminal

The **Dropship Terminal** is a special variant of the
[Air Terminal](../items/Air_Terminal.md) large enough to allow the construction
of the [Galaxy](../vehicles/Galaxy.md) troop transport, the
[Galaxy Gunship](../vehicles/Galaxy_Gunship.md), and
[Lodestar](../vehicles/Lodestar.md) vehicle transport air vehicles.

Other air vehicles ([Liberator](../vehicles/Liberator.md),
[Mosquito](../vehicles/Mosquito.md), [Reaver](../vehicles/Reaver.md),
[Vulture](../vehicles/Vulture.md), [Wasp](../vehicles/Wasp.md),
[Phantasm](../vehicles/Phantasm.md)) may be obtained at this pad too, but this
type of pad is the only place the three largest aircraft can be spawned.

This terminal will not create ground vehicles.

They can only be found at a [Dropship Center](../locations/Dropship_Center.md),
or in [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md).
