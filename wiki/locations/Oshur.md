## [Oshur Prime](locations/Oshur_Prime.md)

The name Oshur once belonged to an extremely rough desert continent
consisting of the broken bones of an impact crater. The rough badlands
and choppy terrain made it relatively easy to hide fairly large forces
in what seemed to be plain view. A giant, unexplained avian skeleton lay
fossilized on the continent, giving rise to lively discussions about the
Ancient Vanu that were there before.

This single-mass continent is now most commonly referred to as "[Oshur
Prime](locations/Oshur_Prime.md)."

## [The Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md): [Battle Islands](Battle_Islands.md)

When [The Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md) occurred, ripping apart our
reality and spreading the [Auraxian](Auraxis.md) continents
across a dozen worlds, Oshur was erased or torn asunder. In its place
appeared 4 smaller landmasses we now call "The [Battle
Islands](Battle_Islands.md)."
