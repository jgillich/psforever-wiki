# Orbital Platform

The **Orbital Platform** is the canon location of the massive weapons that
create [Orbital Strikes](../terminology/Orbital_Strike.md). Players of
[Command Rank](../terminology/Command_Rank.md) 4 and 5 have the ability to use
their [CUD](../weapons/Command_Uplink_Device.md) to order the Orbital Platform
to fire an Orbital Strike at a desired location.

After the [Bending](../terminology/The_Bending.md), due to Orbital Strikes having
already been implemented, the name Orbital Platform was kept, even though it
would be required to have ten times as many due to increased number of planets.
