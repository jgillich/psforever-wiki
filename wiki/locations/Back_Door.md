![ Forces defending a
backdoor against a [Vanu Sovereignty](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) assault](../images/Back_Door_TR.jpg){ class="figure" }

The Back Door is the entry point to the inside of a [Facility](Facilities.md)
which is located outside of the facilities [Courtyard](Courtyard.md). It is an
Infantry-only area, with a door too small for any
[Vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md).

The only built-in defense for a Back Door is a simple
[IFF](../terminology/IFF.md) lock.

However, due to the design of the facility, the back door ("BD") is inherently
easy to defend with a small group. The door connects to a long, low-grade
sloping interior hallway with 90 or 180 degree bends before opening into the
facility's lower levels.

This hallway, when populated with defenders, is impassable via conventional
means, although it is sometimes susceptible to the
[MAX Crash](../etc/MAX_Crash.md) rapid-advance tactic.
