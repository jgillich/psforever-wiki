![](../images/Gun.jpg){ class="figure" } In addition to the standard features found
in all [Towers](Towers.md), the Gun Tower is equipped with two
[Phalanx](../items/Phalanx.md) Wall Turrets on the roof walkway, greatly
increasing their tactical value, and providing reasonably robust defence against
Infantry or Vehicular assault.

(Note: While a [Facility](Facilities.md) expends [NTU](../items/NTU.md) to
auto-repair Wall Turrets, a Gun Tower is considered to have infinite NTU for
this purpose, although the rate is still very slow.)
