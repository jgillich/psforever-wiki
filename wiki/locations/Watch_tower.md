![](../images/Watch-tower.jpg "fig:Watch-tower.jpg") Watch Tower on
[Cyssor](Cyssor.md)\]\]

## Distinctive features

- Five floors
- No [Phalanx](../items/Phalanx.md) roof turrets
- Second floor exterior catwalk
- [Control Console](../locations/Control_Console.md) on level three
- Roof sensor cluster with four vertical aerials

## Description

Unlike the [Air Tower](Air_tower.md) and [Gun Tower](Gun_tower.md), the Watch
Tower has no [Phalanx](../items/Phalanx.md) Wall Turrets.

Standing five stories tall, the Watch Tower is the tallest of all 3
[Tower](Towers.md) types. [VS](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md)
[MAX Units](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) must use both their regular
jump and their jump jet special ability at the same time to reach the roof
directly, though it is still rare to find a [VS](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md)
[MAX Unit](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) at the top of a Watch Tower
given level surrounding terrain.

As is the case with all [Towers](Towers.md), the [Spawn Room](Spawn_Room.md) in
Watch Towers include two [Spawn tubes](../items/Respawn_Tube.md) , three
[Equipment Terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md), and two banks of
[Lockers](../items/Lockers.md).

## Special Capability

Watch towers have a sensor array on the roof, making them capable of sensing
enemy presence, which will display on the
[Tactical Overlay](../terminology/Tactical_Overlay.md).
