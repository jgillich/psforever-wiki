The [Vehicle Terminal](../locations/Vehicle_Terminal.md) is
where you can spawn [vehicles](category:_Vehicles.md) for use. It is typically
located in the [courtyard](Courtyard.md) of a
[facility](../locations/Facilities.md), with the exception of
[Technology Plants](../locations/Technology_Plant.md). The vehicle terminal can
be destroyed by one
[High Explosive Mine](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md) and is
therefore a common site for booby traps set by enemy
[Cloakers](../armor/Infiltration_Suit.md).
