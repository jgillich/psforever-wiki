The **courtyard** is the area enclosed within a [facility's](Facilities.md)
walls. Stairwells at various points along the walls allow access to the
ramparts. Within the walls are various support features such as the
[NTU Silo](NTU_Silo.md), [Repair/Rearm Silos](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md),
and typically the [BFR Shed](../items/BFR_Shed.md) and
[Vehicle Terminal](../locations/Vehicle_Terminal.md). However,
[Technology Plants](../locations/Technology_Plant.md) have both Air and Ground
[Vehicle Terminals](../locations/Vehicle_Terminal.md) enclosed in the main
structure.

The Courtyard has two arched entrances at opposite corners of the base, allowing
vehicular access. These entrances become sealed against most enemy
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) and gunfire with a lattice linked
[Shield Module](../items/Shield_Module.md).
