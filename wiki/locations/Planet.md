There were once ten [continents](Continent.md) on a single
planet named [Auraxis](Auraxis.md), but after [The
Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md), these continents were pushed through
dimensional rifts outward into the galaxy to ten unique planets. These
planets, and their continents, remain connected to one another through
the [Galactic Lattice](../terminology/Galactic_Lattice.md).

Capturing these planets is the main objective of the Auraxian Civil War.
There are two types, [Home Planets](Home_Continent.md) and
[Neutral Planets](../terminology/Neutral_Continent.md). Each type of planet
provides an [Empire Benefit](../terminology/Empire_Benefit.md) should a faction
manage to [capture](../etc/Continental_lock.md) it.

Each continent, and the planet it is located on, can be reached by
traveling through a continent's [warpgates](Warpgate.md) or
[broadcast warpgates](../items/Broadcast_warpgate.md), or via the [HART
Shuttle](../terminology/HART.md) system located in each Empire's
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md). It can also be reached by selecting
[Instant Action](../terminology/Instant_Action.md) from your Esc
[Menu](../etc/Menu.md).

Each Planet and its status can be viewed from the [Interstellar
Map](../terminology/Interstellar_Map.md).
