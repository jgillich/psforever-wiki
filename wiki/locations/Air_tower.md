![](../images/Air.jpg "fig:Air.jpg") Air Tower\]\]

In addition to the standard features found in all [Towers](Towers.md), the Air
Tower is equipped with two [Phalanx](../items/Phalanx.md) Wall Turrets on the
roof walkway, greatly increasing their tactical value, and providing reasonably
robust defence against infantry or vehicular assault.

The Air Tower is further equipped with two
[Landing Pads](../items/Landing_Pad.md) on the top of the roof, allowing
Aircraft to quickly repair and rearm without having to go back to a Friendly
[Facility](Facilities.md). The Phalanx Wall Turrets and the repairing/rearming
[Air Cavalry](../terminology/Air_Cavalry.md) units make the Air Tower that hardest
Tower to capture but it is also the most valuable of the three.

(Note: While a [Facility](Facilities.md) expends [NTU](../items/NTU.md) to
auto-repair Wall Turrets, an Air Tower is considered to have infinite NTU for
this purpose, although the rate is still very slow.)
