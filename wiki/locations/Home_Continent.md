A [Home Continent](Home_Continent.md) (or Home Planet in the
[Post-Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md) era) is simply a
[planet](Planet.md), or [continent](Continent.md) which
possesses a link to an [Empire](../terminology/Empire.md)'s
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md). By link it is implied that this
connection cannot be severed, as in the Sanctuary contains a
[warpgate](Warpgate.md) which leads directly to that planet
without needing to broadcast there. Patch [3.12.28](3.md.12.28)
(July 31, 2007) changed the Home Continents of each empire. The current
Empire Home Continents are

[Vanu Sovereignty](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md):
[Ceryshen](Ceryshen.md) & [Forseral](Forseral.md)

[Terran Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md):
[Solsar](Solsar.md) & [Hossin](Hossin.md)

[New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md):
[Esamir](Esamir.md) & [Amerish](Amerish.md)

Historically the VS had Esamir and Amerish, the TR had Ceryshen and
Forseral, and the NC had Solsar and Hossin.
