A [Home Continent](Home_Continent.md) (or Home Planet in the
[Post-Bending](../terminology/The_Bending.md) era) is simply a [planet](Planet.md), or
[continent](../locations/Continent.md) which possesses a link to an
[Empire](../terminology/Empire.md)'s [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md). By
link it is implied that this connection cannot be severed, as in the Sanctuary
contains a [warpgate](Warpgate.md) which leads directly to that planet without
needing to broadcast there. Patch [3.12.28](../patches/3.12.28.md) (July
31, 2007) changed the Home Continents of each empire. The current Empire Home
Continents are

[Vanu Sovereignty](../factions/Vanu_Sovereignty.md): [Ceryshen](Ceryshen.md) &
[Forseral](Forseral.md)

[Terran Republic](../factions/Terran_Republic.md): [Solsar](Solsar.md) &
[Hossin](Hossin.md)

[New Conglomerate](../factions/New_Conglomerate.md): [Esamir](Esamir.md) &
[Amerish](Amerish.md)

Historically the VS had Esamir and Amerish, the TR had Ceryshen and Forseral,
and the NC had Solsar and Hossin.
