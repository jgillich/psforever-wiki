A Sub-Capitol is any one of four [facilities](Facilities.md) located on each
[Empire](../terminology/Empire.md)'s home [continents](../locations/Continent.md) which is
connected via a green lattice link to the [capitol](Capitol.md) facility.
[Sub-Capitols](Sub-Capitol.md) play an important role in the capture of capitol
[bases](Facilities.md) as they are the only way to disable the facility's
impeneatrable shield barrier, called a [Force Dome](../items/Force_Dome.md). If
two or more Sub-Capitols are held by the same [empire](../terminology/Empire.md)
who owns the capitol facility, the [capitol](Capitol.md) will activate it's
Force Dome barrier. Only by taking three sub-capitals (or taking two and
allowing another invading [empire](../terminology/Empire.md) to take the third)
can you disable this shield. The only way to successfully hack the
[capitol](Capitol.md) facility is by owning two or more Sub-Capitols.
