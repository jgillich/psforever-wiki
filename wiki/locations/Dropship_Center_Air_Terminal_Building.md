As the name says, this Air Terminal Building can only be found in the
[Courtyard](Courtyard.md) of a [Dropship
Center](Dropship_Center.md).

This Building features a Dropship Air Terminal, the only Terminal where
you can acquire a [Lodestar](../vehicles/Lodestar.md),
[Galaxy](../vehicles/Galaxy.md), or [Galaxy
Gunship](../vehicles/Galaxy_Gunship.md), and a [Matrix
Panel](../items/Matrix_Panel.md). The building has two doors, one leading
to the Creation Pad and one leading to the Courtyard.

If the Dropship Center is a [LLU](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md)
[Facility](Facilities.md) the [Lattice Logic Unit
Socket](Lattice_Logic_Unit_Socket.md) will also be in this
Building.
