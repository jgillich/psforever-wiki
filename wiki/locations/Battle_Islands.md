## Description

The name [Oshur](Oshur.md) was once associated with an extremely rough desert
continent consisting of the broken bones of an impact crater. The rough badlands
and choppy terrain made it relatively easy to hide fairly large forces in what
seemed to be plain view. A giant, unexplained avian skeleton once lay fossilized
on the continent, giving rise to lively discussions about the Vanu that were
here before.

But a year ago, the event we know as [The Bending](../terminology/The_Bending.md)
occurred, ripping apart our reality and spreading the Auraxian continents across
a dozen worlds. Oshur was erased or torn asunder, and in its place appeared 4
smaller landmasses we came to call [Battle Islands](Battle_Islands.md)

The Battle Islands have unique vehicle and weapon limitations.
[Heavy Assault](../certifications/Heavy_Assault.md) weaponry can not be
purchased or used on any of the islands.
[BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) and most
[Technology Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md) vehicles can not be
purchased or used. The exceptions are the [Wasp](../vehicles/Wasp.md),
[Phantasm](../vehicles/Phantasm.md), and [Skyguard](../vehicles/Skyguard.md),
which can be purchased on [Desolation](Desolation.md) and used on any Battle
Island. The [Thunderer](../vehicles/Thunderer.md),
[Aurora](../vehicles/Aurora.md), [Raider](../vehicles/Raider.md),
[Galaxy Gunship](../vehicles/Galaxy_Gunship.md), and
[Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md) are also prohibited.

This collection of Battle Islands is sometimes refered to as
[BI](../terminology/Acronyms_and_Slang.md).
