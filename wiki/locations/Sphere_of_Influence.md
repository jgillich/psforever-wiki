A Sphere of Influence radiates invisibly out from the center of each
[facility](Facilities.md) and [tower](Towers.md) on a continent or
[cavern](Caverns.md). Technically, the Sphere of Influence is a cylindrical
shape, extending from the ground to the flight ceiling. On your
[map](../etc/Continental_Map.md), each SOI is color coded Red, Blue, or Purple
for each Empire that controls it, or green for
[neutrality](../terminology/Neutral.md).

This area's main function is as a location for generating
[Experience Point](../terminology/Experience_Points.md) rewards. Anyone within
the SOI for 15min prior to its capture will receive experience points based on
the number and activities of combatants within the sphere. If that person is in
a [squad](../terminology/Squad.md), the rest of the squad members on the same
continent also share in the reward.

[Spitfires](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#spitfire-turret),
[Motion Detectors](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#motion-sensor-alarm),
[Aegis Shield Generators](../weapons/Aegis_Shield_Generator.md),
[TRAPs](../weapons/Tactical_Resonance_Area_Protection.md), and [Cerberus Turrets](../weapons/Cerberus_Turret.md) cannot
be deployed in an enemy SOI (though spitfires can if the user has the
[Assault Engineering](../certifications/Assault_Engineering.md)
[Certification](../certifications/Certification.md)).
[One-Manned Field Turrets](../weapons/One-Manned_Field_Turret.md) can only be
deployed in a neutral SOI and the [Shadow Turrets](../weapons/Shadow_Turret.md)
can only be deployed within a friendly SOI. SOIs also interfere with the
[HART shuttle](../terminology/HART.md) drop pods. All enemy and friendly drop
pods must descend outside of this invisible area.

In addition, the SOI can detect and display a warning on your Continent Map if
an enemy force of certain size is present. The [alert](../terminology/Alert.md)
is coded as yellow, orange, or red depending on the size of the enemy presence.

While players are inside a friendly SOI, they will be affected by the benefits
that that facility provides, as well as any linked benefits that facility might
have. [Module](../etc/Modules.md) benefits that are in place at that facility will also
be triggered for players inside its SOI.

Any player may also use the
[/broadcast channel](../commands/In-Game_Commands.md) within a Friendly Base SOI
as you would in your Empire's Sanctuary; friendly Tower SOIs do not have
/broadcast capability. However, unlike the Sanctuary, this chat only goes to the
SOI you are in, and not the entire continent. When your empire captures the
entire continent, the /broadcast channel functions as it does in the Sanctuary;
it goes to all members of your empire on the continent, regardless of location.

Facility SOI are "x" in diameter. Tower SOI are "y" in diameter.
