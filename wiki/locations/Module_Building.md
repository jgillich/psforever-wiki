Module Buildings can be found in each of the 6
[Core Combat](../items/Core_Combat.md) Caverns. There are 2 Module Buildings in
each cavern.

The Module Building features:

- An [Ancient Control Console](../items/Ancient_Control_Console.md)
- A [Spawn Room](Spawn_Room.md)
- [Ancient Equipment Terminals](../items/Ancient_Equipment_Terminal.md)
- [Module Cradles](../items/Module_Cradle.md)
- [Modules](../etc/Modules.md)
- [Teleporters](../terminology/Teleporter.md)

Module Buildings are the buildings were you can get [Modules](../etc/Modules.md)
that give benefits for the surface facilities after the [Module](../etc/Modules.md) has
been installed in the [Facility](Facilities.md)'s
[Module Cradle](../items/Module_Cradle.md). Each module building spawns 2 modules at a
time, located in the module cradles near the two
[Teleporters](../terminology/Teleporter.md). The modules availible at the
building rotate every 15 minutes and can be predicted by noting the cave timer
on the other caves on the
[Interstellar Map](../terminology/Interstellar_Map.md). Both module buildings in
each cave have the same two modules available at any given time. In order to
take a module from the cradle, your [empire](../terminology/Empire.md) must own
the building. For the module to be installed on the surface, it must first be
charged in the core beam in the [Core Complex](Core_Complex.md).

See [Modules](../etc/Modules.md) for more information about their Benefits.
