Refering to the six subterranean battlegrounds introduced with the expansion
[Core Combat](../items/Core_Combat.md). Each cavern once rested beneath a
continent on the main planet of Auraxis. After
[The Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md), these caves now exist in the cores of
gigantic rogue asteroids.

The six caverns are [Adlivun](Adlivun.md), [Annwn](Annwn.md),
[Byblos](Byblos.md), [Drugaskan](Drugaskan.md), [Hunhau](Hunhau.md), and
[Supai](Supai.md). Access to these caverns is controlled by surface links to
[Geowarps](../locations/Geowarp.md). Two caverns are open at any given time. A new carven
opens every 3.5 hours, meaning each cavern is open for a total of 7 hours at a
time.

Sometimes in Game Lore the caverns are referred to as the
[Auraxian Core](../items/Auraxian_Core.md).
