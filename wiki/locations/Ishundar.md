## Description

The planet housing Ishundar is largely characterized by the high-altitude
continuous sandstorm that carries in the turbulent upper atmosphere, giving a
corona to the sun and constantly raining grit down upon those on the planet's
surface.

This continent is extremely arid and inhospitable to life. Its saltwater lakes
are the only break in the unending bleakness that is Ishundar.

The surface of the continent is extremely rough, making off-roading a challenge
and making roadways something of a predictable path for convoys.

The continent is split in two by a gigantic canyon valley between the two
highlands in Ishundar's center, making traffic flows between the two halves more
predictable and creating bottlenecks for tacticians to exploit.
