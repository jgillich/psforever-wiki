![](../images/NTUSiloPicture.jpg "fig:NTUSiloPicture.jpg") The **NTU Silo** is
an object in all [facility](Facilities.md) courtyards which stores
[NTUs](../items/NTU.md) for use by the facility's
[generator](../items/Generator.md).

[Advanced Nanite Transports](../vehicles/Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md) use the
**NTU Silo** as a drop-off point for their load of NTUs. An **NTU Silo** also
has a small light, located on top of a pole attached to the top of the Silo,
which displays different colors depending on the facilities current NTU status
(Green is Full, or close to full, Yellow is running low, and Red is critical
need for more NTUs).

A Status Bar type display is also located on the front of the Silo, informing
all units of the facilities current NTU status at a glance.

The [BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md)
[NTU Siphon](../weapons/NTU_Siphon.md) weapon system can be used in front of
this silo to charge itself, and drain the base in the process. It can also
deposit NTUs back into friendly bases.
