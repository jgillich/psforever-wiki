# Lounge

![Lounge](../images/TRLounge.jpg){ class="figure" }

Sometimes called the
Kitchen, this room is typically adjacent to the
[respawn room](Spawn_Room.md) in a
[facility](Facilities.md).

The lounge contains a dining table, food storage unit, a sink, cabinets, sofa,
entertainment center, and a holographic tactical situation table.

Stairs lead down from this room to the [Barracks](Barracks.md)
below and from there to the basement.

It should be noted that [Bio Laboratories](Bio_Laboratory.md) do
not have lounges or barracks. Instead they have a special research area with
[lockers](../items/Lockers.md) and a
[Medical Terminal](../items/Medical_Terminal.md). Stairs lead down from this lab
to a creepy storage facility where players will find the bodies of those who
have offended the Planetside Developers and are hung suspended in a viscous
fluid, floating lifelessly until game world ends.
