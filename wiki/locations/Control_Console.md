One control
console (CC) is located in each base and in each tower. Using a
[REK](../weapons/Remote_Electronics_Kit.md), you can hack the console. The time
this takes depends on which level of the
[Hacking](<../certifications/Hacking_(Certification).md>) tree you are certed
in.

- No Hacking [certification](../certifications/Certification.md): 60 seconds
- Hacking [certification](../certifications/Certification.md): 40 seconds
- [Advanced Hacking](../certifications/Advanced_Hacking.md)
  [certification](../certifications/Certification.md): 20 seconds
- [Expert Hacking](../certifications/Expert_Hacking.md)
  [certification](../certifications/Certification.md): 15 seconds

Once hacked, a tower immediately converts to the ownership of the hacker's
[empire](../terminology/Empire.md). For bases, there is a 15 minute timer
activated the moment the hack is activated. When the timer expires, the hacker's
empire gets control of the base except in the case of an
[LLU](../terminology/Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) base. In those cases a 15 minute
timer limits how long the LLU is available to be run to the appropriate base. If
the LLU is not run in time than the hack will be cancelled. The CC can be
immediatly re-hacked however, to start the LLU timer over again.

Bases can only be hacked if they are linked via the
[lattice](../terminology/Lattice.md) to a friendly base, or if the base has gone
[neutral](../terminology/Neutral.md).

Hacking an enemy base will also disrupt their
[Facility Linked Benefits](../terminology/Facility_Linked_Benefit.md).
