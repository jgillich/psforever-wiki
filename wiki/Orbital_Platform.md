The **Orbital Platform** is the canon location of the massive weapons
that create [Orbital Strikes](Orbital_Strike.md "wikilink"). Players of
[Command Rank](Command_Rank.md "wikilink") 4 and 5 have the ability to use
their [CUD](CUD.md "wikilink") to order the Orbital Platform to fire an
Orbital Strike at a desired location.

After the [Bending](Bending.md "wikilink"), due to Orbital Strikes having
already been implemented, the name Orbital Platform was kept, even
though it would be required to have ten times as many due to increased
number of planets.
