**Version 3.15.4 (March 19, 2008)**

- An issue with the [Data Corruption](Data_Corruption.md "wikilink")
  [certification](certification.md "wikilink") has been fixed; players
  with Data Corruption will now be able to infect
  [Spitfires](ACE.md#Spitfire_Turret "wikilink"), [Motion
  Sensors](ACE.md#Motion_Sensor_Alarm "wikilink"), [Wall
  Turrets](Wall_Turret.md "wikilink"), and [Aegis Shield
  Generators](Aegis_Shield_Generator.md "wikilink").
- There is now a chance that a [virus](virus.md "wikilink") will wear off
  much earlier than usual for infected Spitfires, Motion Sensors, Wall
  Turrets, and Aegis Shield Generators.
- The radar icon for the [Sensor
  Disruptor](Sensor_Disruptor.md "wikilink") has been reduced in size,
  especially when radar is set to short range.
- All players will be given an optional certification reset.
