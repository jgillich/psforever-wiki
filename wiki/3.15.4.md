**Version 3.15.4 (March 19, 2008)**

-   An issue with the [Data Corruption](Data_Corruption "wikilink")
    [certification](certification "wikilink") has been fixed; players
    with Data Corruption will now be able to infect
    [Spitfires](ACE#Spitfire_Turret "wikilink"), [Motion
    Sensors](ACE#Motion_Sensor_Alarm "wikilink"), [Wall
    Turrets](Wall_Turret "wikilink"), and [Aegis Shield
    Generators](Aegis_Shield_Generator "wikilink").
-   There is now a chance that a [virus](virus "wikilink") will wear off
    much earlier than usual for infected Spitfires, Motion Sensors, Wall
    Turrets, and Aegis Shield Generators.
-   The radar icon for the [Sensor
    Disruptor](Sensor_Disruptor "wikilink") has been reduced in size,
    especially when radar is set to short range.
-   All players will be given an optional certification reset.
