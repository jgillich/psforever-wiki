**Mosquito**

The **Mosquito** is a fast, agile, and lightly armored scout craft. It
carries only a 12mm light rotary chaingun, but it can easily slip past
automated defenses (it's not visible on enemy radar).

Additionally, the Mosquito carries radar capable of picking up enemy
troops at fairly long range and transmitting that information to nearby
friendly forces, causing enemy troops to be shown on other players'
[Proximity Maps](Proximity_Map.md).

The onboard radar works only at thrust settings of 50% or lower, and may
not pick up motionless or [shielded](Sensor_Shield.md) enemies.
