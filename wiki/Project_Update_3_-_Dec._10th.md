Just a quick update. I've been swamped with finals and projects the last
month or so. That's ending really soon. I'm nearly done with a capture
upload for you guys. ETA: 2 weeks. Login server work will begin late
December. ETA: unknown as the project scope isn't completely defined.

As I obviously cannot keep "weekly" updates to save my life, I will just
have regular updates from now on.

Any questions, comments, concerts, rants, suggestions?
