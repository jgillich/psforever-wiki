Governs how quickly one can [respawn](respawn.md) at a [respawn
point](spawn_point.md) after death. The lowest a timer may go is
1 second. The greatest a timer may go is 1 minute. Respawning at the
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md) always has a spawn timer of zero.

The timer increases with each death, but can be reduced by staying alive
longer, with the [Bio Laboratory](Bio_Laboratory.md) or [Speed
Module](Speed_Module.md) benefit, or with an [Empire
Incentive](Empire_Incentives.md) bonus due to low population.
Selecting to spawn at an [AMS](AMS.md) always has a shorter
respawn timer than the longest option.
