[Support](/Support "wikilink") roles involve helping other members of
your team in any manner. This can include healing other players,
repairing other players and [vehicles](/vehicle "wikilink"), reviving
fallen comrades, Hacking Terminals and [Lockers](/Locker "wikilink") for
your teammates to use, and driving the support vehicles.

## Infantry Support

Infantry Support includes the activity of healing or repairing other
soldiers as well as reviving other soldiers. This is one of the most
important support activities, as without it, soldiers would die far too
quickly to be effective.

### Healing and Repairing

Two of the most basic support activies, but possibly two of the most
important. Without this, soldiers would not last more than two duels, as
their [health](/health "wikilink") and [armor](/armor "wikilink") would be
far too low to go on. This is where the medic and engineer come in to
heal and repair a soldier to help him fight far longer than he would
normally be able to.

Available Support Merits:

- [Combat Medic](/Combat_Medic "wikilink")
- [Infantry Armor Support](/Infantry_Armor_Support "wikilink")

### Reviving

When a player attains the [Advanced
Medical](/Advanced_Medical "wikilink")
[certification](/certification "wikilink"), that player can use the
[Medical Applicator](/Medical_Applicator "wikilink") to revive a fallen
comrade, given that the victim has not yet released to
[respawn](/respawn "wikilink"). However, when reviving a player, great
care must be taken, as a revived player who has not been repaired at all
will often spawn with little to no armor, so it is wise to have an
engineer nearby to boost his armor up as well.

Available [Merit Commendations](/Merit_Commendations "wikilink"):

- [Combat Resuscitation](/Combat_Resuscitation "wikilink")
- [Resuscitation Medic](/Resuscitation_Medic "wikilink")

## Equipment Support

Equipment Support involves using a [Nano
Dispenser](/Nano_Dispenser "wikilink") from the Engineering certification
to repair [vehicles](/vehicle "wikilink"), [Phalanx](/Phalanx "wikilink")
turrets, and [Spitfires](/Spitfire "wikilink"). Generally, it is more
difficult to find dedicated Equipment supporters in the field since Nano
Dispensers are harder to carry since a player has to sacrifice an entire
rifle slot, as opposed to a [Body Armor Nano
Kit](/Body_Armor_Nano_Kit "wikilink"), Medical Applicator, or [Remote
Electronics Kit](/Remote_Electronics_Kit "wikilink"), in which the player
only has to sacrifice a pistol slot.

Available [Merit Commendations](/Merit_Commendations "wikilink"):

- [Equipment Support](/Equipment_Support "wikilink")
- [Tiny Robotics Support](/Tiny_Robotics_Support "wikilink")

## Hacking Support

Hacking Support involves using a [Remote Electronics
Kit](/Remote_Electronics_Kit "wikilink") along with the
[Hacking](</Hacking_(Certification)> "wikilink") or [Advanced
Hacking](/Advanced_Hacking "wikilink") to hack enemy terminals for your
[Empire](/Empire "wikilink") to use for a short amount of time. This type
of support is invaluable as soldiers who are caught deep within enemy
territory who are low on ammunition often need the support of a friendly
hacker to convert an [Equipment Terminal](/Equipment_Terminal "wikilink")
to their side temporarily.

Available [Merit Commendations](/Merit_Commendations "wikilink"):

- [Hacking Support](/Hacking_Support "wikilink")
- [Locker Safe Cracker](/Locker_Safe_Cracker "wikilink")

## Vehicular Support

Vehicular Support involves using one of the support
[vehicles](/vehicle "wikilink") in [PlanetSide](/PlanetSide "wikilink") to
its full use to help your empire. This is extremely important, as many
of these vehicles fill roles that are absolutely necessary for the
gameplay to flow.

### Advanced Mobile Station

The [Advanced Mobile Station](/Advanced_Mobile_Station "wikilink") is
perhaps the most important support vehicle in the game. It allows
soldiers to [respawn](/respawn "wikilink") at much closer distances than
they would normal be able to, and it gives soldiers who are low on ammo
an area to replenish their supplies. This vehicle has almost no
offensive abilities and is clearly a support vehicle, and fills one of
the most important roles in the game.

Available [Merit Commendations](/Merit_Commendations "wikilink"):

- [AMS Support](/AMS_Support "wikilink")
- [Defense Merit
  Commendations](/Defense_Merit_Commendations "wikilink")
- [Transportation Citation](/Transportation_Citation "wikilink")

### Galaxy Support

When a ground invasion of a base fails, often the skies are the best way
to get into a base. This is where the [Galaxy](/Galaxy "wikilink") comes
in, it allows players to get onto a base in an unexpected way which will
often throw base defenders off. However, one person who is often never
creditted for this act is the actual Galaxy pilot. He sacrifices his
time to get his teammates where they need to be, and, thus, holds one of
the most important support roles in the game.

Available [Merit Commendations](/Merit_Commendations "wikilink"):

- [Galaxy Support Pilot](/Galaxy_Support_Pilot "wikilink")
- [Defense Merit
  Commendations](/Defense_Merit_Commendations "wikilink")

### Lodestar Support

When a [vehicle](/vehicle "wikilink") is heavily damaged and far into
enemy territory without an Engineer nearby to repair him, the
[Lodestar](/Lodestar "wikilink") is where he turns. A floating [repair
silo](/repair_silo "wikilink"), the lodestar provides much needed repairs
to vehicles who would be long gone without it. A powerful support tool
in the right hand, the Lodestar fills a vital role in
[PlanetSide](/PlanetSide "wikilink").

Available [Merit Commendations](/Merit_Commendations "wikilink"):

- [Lodestar Support](/Lodestar_Support "wikilink")
- [Defense Merit
  Commendations](/Defense_Merit_Commendations "wikilink")

### Router Support

Speed is the key to any team, and the [Router](/Router "wikilink") helps
get soldiers where they need to be. This allows soldiers cross huge
distances in a split second, but the enemy can utilize enemy Routers, so
careful Router and telepad placement is important. The
[Merit](/Merit_Commendation "wikilink") for this encourages good router
and telepad placement.

Available [Merit Commendations](/Merit_Commendations "wikilink"):

- [Defense Merit
  Commendations](/Defense_Merit_Commendations "wikilink")
- [Router Support](/Router_Support "wikilink")
- [Telepad Deployment](/Telepad_Deployment "wikilink")
- [Transportation Citation](/Transportation_Citation "wikilink")
