Released Thursday, December 22, 2005.

Introduces a number of adjustments to [BFRs](BFR.md).

- Added BFR shield strength indicator for players with the [Enhanced
  Targeting](Enhanced_Targeting.md)
  [Implant](Implant.md)
- Flight Variant BFR shield deactivates when the BFR starts flying and
  remains inactive until a few seconds after the BFR lands
- Flight Variant BFR shield drains while the BFR remains flying
- All weaponry that can lock onto flight vehicles can now also lock
  onto Flight Variant BFRs while they are flying
- [Flak](Flak.md) projectiles (like the ones fired by the TR
  [Burster](Burster.md) MAX and the
  [Skyguard](Skyguard.md)) now detonate on proximity to flying
  Flight Variant BFRs as they do with other flying vehicles
