![](images/BFR_term.jpg "fig:BFR_term.jpg") The BFR Shed is used to acquire
[BattleFrame Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics.md) units, similar
to the [Vehicle Terminal](Vehicle_Terminal.md).

These structures are located in the [Courtyard](Courtyard.md) of
all [Facilities](Facilities.md) except those located in the
[Caverns](Caverns.md) or on the [Battle
Islands](Battle_Islands.md).

The system can be disabled by destroying the terminal located in the
small alcove, thereby preventing acquisition of BFRs from that facility
until it can be repaired.

An enemy BFR Terminal can also be [Hacked](Hack.md) by an
[Advanced Hacker](Advanced_Hacking.md) and used to acquire
friendly BFRs.

They are good spots for snipers to shoot from, as they are one of the
few tall areas where aircraft are allowed to land.
