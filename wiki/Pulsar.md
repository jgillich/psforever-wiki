**Pulsar**

[image:Pulsar-Icon.jpg](image:Pulsar-Icon.md.jpg)

The [Pulsar](Pulsar.md) functions well as an outdoor
anti-infantry weapon, as it has a high projectile velocity, and good
accuracy, especially fired from a crouched position. The AP mode means
that even MAX units will fear sustained fire from this weapon.

Unlike the [Cycler](Cycler.md) and [Gauss](Gauss.md),
the [Pulsar](Pulsar.md)'s projectiles will not travel under
water. The Pulsar's [AP](Armor_Piercing.md) projectiles are also
not as powerful as the other empire's weapons, but this is offset by the
fact that the user can change ammo types instantly. A non-native user
will be unable to obtain the [energy ammunition](Energy_Cell.md)
from equipment terminals.

Incentives](Empire_Incentives.md) applied)
