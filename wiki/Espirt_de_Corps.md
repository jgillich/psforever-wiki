Espirt de Corps is a Special Operations Outfit .

When we are not doing Spec Ops we are generally all grouped up for the
most part kicking ass and ranking in the BEP.

We are a non TK outfit, so unless someone asks you to kill them DO NOT
TK! If you are dueling try to do it away from the zerg. Thanks!

Join you must have the following....

(1.)Teamspeak.

(2.)Must have a Terren republic character on Emerald server.

(3.)Most importantly have to have respect for others.

(4.)Have 1 of these 3 certifications: Adv med, AI max or Spec Assault.

(5.)And HAVE FUNN!!!!

Despite the fact that is was rapidly rising the outfit ranks, in early
2007, it died, with most of it's members quiting palnetisde within a
week of each other.

AS OF 2006, THIS OUTFIT IS NO LONGER ACTIVE!
