**Rocket Pod**

Rockets are self-propelled explosive devices launched from the
[Punisher](Punisher.md) or [Rocklet
Rifle](Rocklet_Rifle.md). Unlike grenades, a rocket travel in a
straight line until it strikes an object or burns all of its fuel. At
this point, the rocket will explode. Rocket Pods can be acquired at any
[equipment terminal](equipment_terminal.md) by any
[empire](Empire.md). Rockets are effective against both infantry
and armored targets.

Because Rockets are considered anti-vehicular weapons, they _cannot_
pass though the energy shields of [BattleFrame
Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics.md).
