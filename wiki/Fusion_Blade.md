**Fusion Blade**

**Only attendees of the 2007, 2009-2011 Las Vegas [Fan
Faires](/Fan_Faire "wikilink") and [Black Ops](/Black_Ops "wikilink") can
currently obtain the Fusion Blade**

The Fusion Blade was awarded to attendees of the 2007, 2009-2011 Las
Vegas Fan Faires. It is also awarded very rarely by Game Managers during
special in-game events. Black Ops soldiers can also access it while they
are transformed. You can acquire the Fusion Blade from an [Equipment
Terminal](/Equipment_Terminal "wikilink") under the **Melee Weapons**
tab, and can also be saved under a Favorite. The Fusion Blade will
replace an [Empires](/Empire "wikilink") Combat Knife and can be equipped
from holster 5. A player cannot carry both the Fusion Blade and his
Empire's Combat Knife at the same time. Fusion Blades are not visible in
corpse [backpacks](/backpack "wikilink") and cannot be looted.

In primary mode the Fusion Blade uses slashes to damage opponents, in
secondary fire, the speed of the slashes is increased dramatically. The
Sword also glows (Yellow for [NC](/New_Conglomerate "wikilink"), Teal for
[VS](/Vanu_Sovereignty "wikilink"), Red for
[TR](/Terran_Republic "wikilink"), and green for [Black
Ops](/Black_Ops "wikilink")) and makes a distinctive sound when in
Secondary Mode. The damage for both modes is the same and the only
difference between the two modes is the speed of the slashes.

In both modes, the Fusion Blade will deal 19 [Health](/Health "wikilink")
and 6 Armor damage to all [armors](/armor "wikilink") (Full Health and
Armor, no [Implants](/Implant "wikilink") or
[MedKits](/MedKit "wikilink")).
