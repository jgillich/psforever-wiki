**Enhanced Targeting** provides enhanced targeting information to its
user. For targets that are in range, Enhanced Targetting displays the
relative health and armor values of enemy soldiers,
[vehicles](vehicle "wikilink"), [BFRs](BFR "wikilink"), and [One-Manned
Field Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret "wikilink"). The
[implant](implant "wikilink") also lets the user see the shield strength
of BFRs and One-Manned Field Turrets. Additionally, the "[identify
friend or foe](IFF "wikilink")" recognition of targets kicks in at
greater range, and enemy [deployables](ACE "wikilink"), such as mines,
are also detected at greater range.

Enhanced Targeting does not use [Stamina](Stamina "wikilink"), but will
turn off if Stamina runs to zero. Also, while Enhanced Targeting will
automatically turn on after
[initialization](Initialization_timer "wikilink"), it does not
automatically turn on if it has been turned off manually or as a result
of running out of Stamina.

**Enhanced Targeting used to be called Advanced Targeting.**
