**Enhanced Targeting** provides enhanced targeting information to its
user. For targets that are in range, Enhanced Targetting displays the
relative health and armor values of enemy soldiers,
[vehicles](Vehicle.md), [BFRs](BattleFrame_Robotics.md), and [One-Manned
Field Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret.md). The
[implant](Implants.md) also lets the user see the shield strength
of BFRs and One-Manned Field Turrets. Additionally, the "[identify
friend or foe](IFF.md)" recognition of targets kicks in at
greater range, and enemy [deployables](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md), such as mines,
are also detected at greater range.

Enhanced Targeting does not use [Stamina](Stamina.md), but will
turn off if Stamina runs to zero. Also, while Enhanced Targeting will
automatically turn on after
[initialization](Initialization_timer.md), it does not
automatically turn on if it has been turned off manually or as a result
of running out of Stamina.

**Enhanced Targeting used to be called Advanced Targeting.**
