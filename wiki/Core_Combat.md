Released on 27 October 2003, **Core Combat** is the first and only
expansion for [PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md). Adding the Auraxian
Core
[Caverns](Caverns.md)(pre-[Bending](The_Bending.md)) as
a playable area, Core Combat adds six distinct cavern environments to
maximize tactical potential in the Empire's quests to control
[Auraxis](Auraxis.md). In addition to the caverns, new vehicles,
weapons and gameplay elements were introduced. When first released, it
was required to purchase the expansion to use the new additions, but it
is now included for free with an account.

## Caverns

The six cavern areas are:

- [Adlivun](Adlivun.md)
- [Annwn](Annwn.md)
- [Byblos](Byblos.md)
- [Drugaskan](Drugaskan.md)
- [Hunhau](Hunhau.md)
- [Supai](Supai.md)

Each cavern is linked to four continental
[Geowarps](Geowarp.md), adding new [Lattice](Lattice.md)
links to each [continent](Continent.md). However, only two
caverns are active at any given time, making time a critical factor in
cavern attacks and usage of the cavern links.

## Cavern Base Facilities

Down in the caverns, the base facilities are quite different from those
that are on the surface. While they are captured just the same, they do
not provide the same functions that surface bases to. The cavern
[facilities](Facilities.md) were created to facilitate the
creation and movement of modules to the surface. Four cavern facility
types inhabit the caverns:

- [AT Plant](AT_Plant.md)
- [Core Complex](Core_Complex.md) - This is a non-capturable
  facility
- [Module Building](Module_Building.md)
- [Redoubt Building](Redoubt_Building.md)

## Modules

Added to spice up gameplay, one of the new features introduced was the
[modules](Modules.md). When installed inside a surface base
facility, modules grant the facility and the controlling empire certain
benefits, depending on the type of module installed. Currently, six
types of modules are available to be installed:

- [Equipment Module](Equipment_Module.md) (blue)
- [Health Module](Health_Module.md) (yellow)
- [Pain Module](Pain_Module.md) (beige)
- [Shield Module](Shield_Module.md) (aqua)
- [Speed Module](Speed_Module.md) (orange)
- [Vehicle Module](Vehicle_Module.md) (purple)

In order to obtain a module, one must go to the caverns, capture a
[Module Building](Module_Building.md), obtain a non-powered
module, and take it to the Core Complex to be charged. Once the module
is removed from the [Module Building](Module_Building.md), the
player has fifteen minutes to charge the module and bring it to the
surface. Once on the surface, the player has an additional fifteen
minutes to install the module into a friendly base. Once the module is
placed in a [Module Cradle](Module_Cradle.md), all bases linked
to the module will recieve the benefits. Each
[Empire](Empire.md) has a limit to the number of
[Modules](Modules.md) they have have installed at any given
time. If exceeded, the only way to gain more modules is to steal them
from enemy bases that have them.

## Crystals

Scattered throughout the caverns are multi-colored
[crystals](Crystal.md) that provide different benefits depending
on the color. All a unit need do is stand next to the crystal to
activate it. Several crystal structures exist:

- [Damage Crystal](Damage_Crystal.md) (purple)
- [Health Crystal](Health_Crystal.md) (red)
- [Repair Crystal](Repair_Crystal.md) (clear/translucent)
- [Weapon Energy Crystal](Weapon_Energy_Crystal.md) (yellow)
- [Vehicle Energy Crystal](Vehicle_Energy_Crystal.md) (green)

## Transportation

There are two methods of transportation unique to the caverns. These are

- [Ziplines](Zipline.md)
- [Teleporters](Teleporter.md)

## Weaponry

- [Maelstrom](Maelstrom.md)
- [Spiker](Spiker.md)
- [Radiator](Radiator.md)
- [Ancient Sentry Turret](Ancient_Sentry_Turret.md)

## Vehicles

- [Flail](Flail.md)
- [Router](Router.md)
- [Switchblade](Switchblade.md)
