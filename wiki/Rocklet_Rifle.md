**Rocklet Rifle**

The [Rocklet Rifle](/Rocklet_Rifle "wikilink") is a medium-range compact
rocket launcher. Each launched rocklet packs a significant explosion
that is equally effective against vehicles and infantry.

The secondary fire mode fires all remaining rocklets in the clip in
rapid succession. However, this mode is considerably less accurate than
the primary setting and as such is best relegated for use in short to
medium-short range.

One of the best uses for this weapon is to clear [ACE](/ACE "wikilink")
devices. It can take out a spitfire easily while being outside of its
firing radius. It can also detonate mines with one direct rocklet hit.
When in secondary fire mode, you can deprive a [MAX](/MAX "wikilink")
unit of all armor in mere seconds, leaving it vulnerable to other
friendlies to finish it off. It's best to turn auto-reload off when
using this weapon, so you can switch to a secondary weapon to finish
your target off quickly without waiting for the long reload time, as
it's rare to kill a [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](/Reinforced_Exo-Suit "wikilink") in one clip (since all 6 have
to hit).

## Flaklet

As of the [3.6.9](/3.6.9 "wikilink") patch, the Rocklet is also capable
of firing fragmentation rounds as flak that explodes within the
proximity of aircraft. The damage from the flaklet does less damage per
round than the rocklet on aircraft, but its ability to explode nearby
without actually hitting the target can be worth it. Note that when used
on ground targets, the Flaklet does very little damage (i.e. almost
completely worthless). See [Fragmentation Grenade
Pack](/Fragmentation_Grenade_Pack "wikilink")
