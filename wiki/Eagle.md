![](images/EagleFV.jpg "fig:EagleFV.jpg") [Eagle](Eagle.md "wikilink")\]\] The
**Eagle** is the flight variant of [BattleFrame
Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics.md "wikilink") developed by the [New
Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate.md "wikilink").

Flight variants are single-pilot BFRs with a flight pack on their backs
to allow the BFR to fly vertically for a short amount of time (in a
similar manner to the [VS](VS.md "wikilink") [MAX](MAX.md "wikilink") units'
jump-jets). The flight systems are powered by the "BFR capacitor", which
is measured with a small bar on the player's [HUD](HUD.md "wikilink"). The
capacitor recharges over time when the flight systems are not in use.
When a flight variant uses its flight systems, the shields are
deactivated for the entire time the BFR is in the air, reactivating once
it lands. Additionally, the shield levels will be drained as long as the
BFR is in flight. The BFR can remain airborne until the capacitor is
drained, then it will begin dropping back to the ground.

Flight variants have much less armor and take a larger amount of time to
regenerate their shields compared to their gunner counterparts.
Conversely, flight variants can run and walk much faster than the ground
variants, giving them the ability to flee relatively quickly when under
attack.

## Pilot Weapons

The pilot weapons available to the Eagle are

- The [Hammer](Hammer.md "wikilink") (Anti-Infantry)
- The [Sparrow](<Sparrow_(BFR)> "wikilink") Missile Pod (Anti-Aircraft)
- The [Anti-Tank Machine Gun](Anti.$1.md "wikilink")
  (Anti-Vehicular)
- The [NTU Siphon](NTU_Siphon.md "wikilink")
- The [Armor Siphon](Armor_Siphon.md "wikilink") (Anti-Vehicular)

The pilot can equip two of these weapons, in any combination.
Additionally, it is possible to manually deactivate one of the weapons,
using them one at a time (one weapon must always remain active,
however).
