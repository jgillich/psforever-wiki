**ATV**

While lightly armored, these vehicles make up for it with superior
handling capabilities and incredible speed, all reaching nearly 90kph.

It is possible to drive these vehicles while wearing any infantry armor,
including the [Reinforced Exo-Suit](Reinforced_Exo.$1.md "wikilink") (not
including a MAX). In addition to this, the driver may bail off of the
wheeled vehicles at any time, regardless of speed.
