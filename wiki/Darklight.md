[image:Darklight.gif](image:Darklight.md.gif "wikilink") The Darklight
implant enables the user to detect cloaked enemies and equipment
([Infiltration Suits](Infiltration_Suit.md "wikilink"),
[Phantasms](Phantasm.md "wikilink"), [Shadow
Turrets](Shadow_Turret.md "wikilink") and [Wraiths](Wraith.md "wikilink")) but
reduces total sight distance to only a few meters.

With a one-minute initialization time and a significant stamina
discharge, this implant must be used intermittantly during normal-motion
operations, or the user must remain still to use it continuously.

Darklight takes 3 stamina points to start up. You also cannot use it
while in [Third person](Third_person.md "wikilink") view. Troops with
Darklight activated will have the Darklight icon next to their name.
