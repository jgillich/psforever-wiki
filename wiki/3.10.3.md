## Update Highlights

- NVIDIA CG DLLs have been updated from 1.0 to 1.4.
- Holiday features have been removed (hats, gift boxes, tree lights,
  and the /humbug command)
- Fixed a bug where the Lasers on the [Aphelion](/Aphelion "wikilink")
  and [Eclipse](/Eclipse "wikilink") would not always do damage when
  fired directly upon a stationary target.
