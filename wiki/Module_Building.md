Module Buildings can be found in each of the 6 [Core
Combat](Core_Combat.md) Caverns. There are 2 Module Buildings in
each cavern.

The Module Building features:

- An [Ancient Control Console](Ancient_Control_Console.md)
- A [Spawn Room](Spawn_Room.md)
- [Ancient Equipment Terminals](Ancient_Equipment_Terminal.md)
- [Module Cradles](Module_Cradle.md)
- [Modules](Modules.md)
- [Teleporters](Teleporter.md)

Module Buildings are the buildings were you can get
[Modules](Modules.md) that give benefits for the surface
facilities after the [Module](Module.md) has been installed in
the [Facility](Facilities.md)'s [Module
Cradle](Module_Cradle.md). Each module building spawns 2 modules
at a time, located in the module cradles near the two
[Teleporters](Teleporter.md). The modules availible at the
building rotate every 15 minutes and can be predicted by noting the cave
timer on the other caves on the [Interstellar
Map](Interstellar_Map.md). Both module buildings in each cave
have the same two modules available at any given time. In order to take
a module from the cradle, your [empire](empire.md) must own the
building. For the module to be installed on the surface, it must first
be charged in the core beam in the [Core
Complex](Core_Complex.md).

See [Modules](Modules.md) for more information about their
Benefits.
