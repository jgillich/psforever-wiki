**Waypoints** are markers placed on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink"), and show up in the
[HUD](HUD.md "wikilink") as pillars of light with animated arrowheads at
the base.

There are many different waypoints in
[PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md "wikilink"):

- **Squad/Platoon Waypoints**: These waypoints are placed by Squad
  leaders that are [Command Rank](Command_Rank.md "wikilink") 1 or
  higher. These are visible to all members of the
  [squad](squad.md "wikilink") the CR1 is leading, and are shared between
  squads in a [platoon](platoon.md "wikilink"). These waypoints are
  colored according to the position of the [Squad
  Leader](Squad_Leader.md "wikilink") setting them within a platoon,
  i.e., waypoints set by a particular squad leader will match the
  color of that squad's names in the [Squad
  Bar](Heads.$1.md#Squad_Bar "wikilink").

<!-- -->

- **Squad Experience Waypoint**: This waypoint is represented by a
  blue diamond. The closer you are to this waypoint, the more [Battle
  Experience Points](Battle_Experience_Points.md "wikilink") you get when
  another member of your squad scores a kill in the same zone. The
  squad leader can keep the location of this as the centroid of the
  squad (default) or change it to follow a specific squad member (done
  in the "manage" tab) if he is [Command
  Rank](Command_Rank.md "wikilink") 3 or higher.

<!-- -->

- **Squad Home Base Waypoint**: A [Squad Home
  Base](Squad_Home_Base.md "wikilink") (if one is set) is marked by a
  green triangle on the [Continental Map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink")
  as a waypoint.

<!-- -->

- **LLU Waypoint**: If a player has an [LLU](LLU.md "wikilink") in their
  inventory a purple triangular waypoint will appear indicating the
  destination the LLU must be taken to.

<!-- -->

- **Personal Waypoint**: Players can set a single [Personal
  Waypoint](Personal_Waypoint.md "wikilink"), colored white and visible
  only to themselves, to aid navigation within a
  [zone](zone.md "wikilink").

<!-- -->

- **Laze Pointer Waypoint**: With the [Laze
  Pointer](Laze_Pointer.md "wikilink"), any soldier can set a temporary
  waypoint for use as a target for a [Flail](Flail.md "wikilink") or a
  [Liberator](Liberator.md "wikilink") bombing run. This will be
  color-coded and marked with the squad member's number.

[category:Terminology](category:Terminology.md "wikilink")

There are also 3 special waypoints that have unique differences from the
ones listed above:

- **Orbital Strike Waypoint**: If a friendly
  [CR4](Command_Rank.md "wikilink") or [CR5](Command_Rank.md "wikilink")
  player has placed an [Orbital Strike](Orbital_Strike.md "wikilink")
  waypoint on the map, it is visible as a colored beam of light in the
  gameworld: blue for [NC](NC.md "wikilink"), red for
  [TR](TR.md "wikilink"), and purple for [VS](VS.md "wikilink"). The
  waypoint is not visible on the [Proximity
  Map](Proximity_Map.md "wikilink") or the [Continental
  Map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink").

<!-- -->

- **Rabbit Waypoint**: If there is a [Rabbit](Rabbit.md "wikilink")
  [event](event.md "wikilink") on the zone you are on, an orange circular
  waypoint will appear on your proximity and continental maps. This
  waypoint is not visible in the gameworld as the other waypoints are.
  The waypoint will point in the direction of the rabbit ball.

<!-- -->

- **Vehicle Waypoint**: If you own a [vehicle](vehicle.md "wikilink"),
  but are not currently operating it, a yellow rectangle will appear
  on the proximity map pointing in the direction of your vehicle if it
  is not within the range of the proximity map's current zoom setting.
