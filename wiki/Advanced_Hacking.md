**Advanced Hacking**

The **Advanced Hacking** certification further reduces the time needed
to [hack](hack.md) objects with a
[REK](Remote_Electronics_Kit.md). It also gives the ability to
[jack](jack.md) Enemy [Vehicles](Vehicle.md) (the
vehicle needs to be empty for it to work), [One-Manned Field
Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret.md) (occupied or not, but will
deconstruct instead of switching to the hacker's Empire), and hack
[Equipment Terminals](Equipment_Terminal.md), [Vehicle
Terminals](Vehicle_Terminal.md), [BFR
Terminals](BFR_Shed.md) and [Advanced Medical
Terminals](Advanced_Medical_Terminal.md). [Main
Consoles](Main_Console.md) can also be hacked provided it is in
a friendly facility with the [generator](generator.md) online
and at least one active [spawn tube](spawn_tube.md).

The [Jacking](</Jacking_(Merit)>) and [Hack Support
Specialist](Hack_Support_Specialist.md) [Merit
Commendations](Merit_Commendation.md) can only be obtained by
use of this [Certification](Certification.md).
