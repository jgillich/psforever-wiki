Governs how quickly one can [recall](Recall.md) back to
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md).

- Friendly [SOI](Sphere_of_Influence.md): 10 seconds
- Neutral [SOI](Sphere_of_Influence.md) or open country: 20 seconds
- Enemy [SOI](Sphere_of_Influence.md): 30 seconds

(If you are on a [continent](Continent.md) that is locked by
your [Empire](Empire.md), you will be able to recall in 10
seconds, even if you are outside a [Facility](Facilities.md)'s
[SOI](Sphere_of_Influence.md). If you are on a continent that is locked by an
opposing Empire, it will take 30 seconds to recall, even if you are
outside of an SOI.

These timers are also the time required to exit the PS client normally.
