Annwn is one of the six [Core Combat](Core_Combat.md)
[Caverns](Caverns.md) and is characterized by teal soil, green
marble crystals, and cyan [ziplines](Zipline.md).

This cavern is drastically different from other caverns, as it's laid
out vertically instead of horizontally. The
[Redoubts](Redoubt.md) and [AT Plants](AT_Plant.md) are
on the floor, while the [Module Buildings](Module_Building.md)
are near the top. The [Core Complex](Core_Complex.md) lies right
in the middle. Buildings and rock seem to hang in mid-air.

Many inexperienced cavers find it difficult to find their way to the top
of the cavern from the bottom. [This
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNGul7wCayw) shows some of the
most common and efficient ziplines to navigate the cavern.

It can be assumed that the origin of the cavern's name comes from the
paradise-esque underworld [Annwn](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annwyn)
in Welsh mythology.
