Version 3.9.9 (November 18 2005)

**Update Highlights**

- Added sorting to the Training Mission list so that startable
  missions sort to the top.
- The "Reveal Friendlies" and "Reveal Enemies"
  [Uplink](Command_Uplink_Device.md "wikilink") functions now display
  [Vehicle](Vehicle.md "wikilink") Icons.

**AMS Changes:**

- Fixed a bug that caused players to get stuck inside deployed
  [AMSes](AMS.md "wikilink") when parked next to walls or trees.
- Fixed a bug that would occasionally keep deployed AMSes from being
  undeployed.

**MAX Changes:**

- Fixed a bug that allowed [TR](TR.md "wikilink")
  [MAXes](Mechanized_Armored_Exo.$1.md "wikilink") to pass through
  walls by combining [Autorun](Autorun.md "wikilink") and
  [Anchoring](Anchoring.md "wikilink").
- Fixed a bug where MAX Armors could get stuck with full Autorun speed
  by hitting Esc at the Broadcast [Warpgate](Warpgate.md "wikilink")
  selection screen.
- Fixed a bug that caused MAX purchase timers to be started when MAX
  Armor was purchased as part of a favorite in the [Virtual
  Training](VR_training.md "wikilink") [zones](zone.md "wikilink").

**Miscellaneous Changes:**

- Fixed a bug with the Mission Status window where some times the text
  would not fade all of the way in.
- Dropped [Striker](Striker.md "wikilink") Ammo should now be visible.
