Lockers are personal storage locations within every
[Facility](facilities.md "wikilink"). It functions similar to a backpack
inventory and is 26 x 16 units in size.

## Using Lockers

Lockers cannot be destroyed.

Placing an item in a locker will allow retrieval of that item at **any**
other locker, with some limitations.

### Accessing Contents

To access a Locker, approach and press the "G" key (by default). This
will open up the Locker window, as well as your
[Inventory](Inventory.md "wikilink") window. You may then click and drag an
item either from your Inventory to the Locker, or vice versa. If you
want to take something out of the Locker, right clicking it will
immediatly place it into your Inventory as well.

#### Friendly Facilities

Lockers can always be accessed in a Friendly Facility, no matter the
Facility's condition, this means you can use Lockers even when the
Facility is hacked, or when its [generator](generator.md "wikilink") is
down.

#### Enemy and Neutral Facilities

Lockers in Enemy or Neutral Facilities can be hacked if you have the
basic [Hacking](<Hacking_(Certification)> "wikilink")
[certification](certification.md "wikilink"). Note however that the
Facility's generator must be online, if it is destroyed than you cannot
use the Lockers.

It is not possible to steal things from someone else's Locker.

## Locations

Lockers are located in the [Spawn Room](Spawn_Room.md "wikilink") of all
bases and towers, the [Barracks](Barracks.md "wikilink") in each facility
(excluding [Bio Laboratories](Bio_Laboratory.md "wikilink")), the [Medical
Bay](Medical_Bay.md "wikilink"), [Research Room](Research_Room.md "wikilink"),
and
[certification](certification.md "wikilink")/[Implant](Implant.md "wikilink")
room of Bio Labs, and the Observation Deck of the
[HART](HART.md "wikilink") building in each Empire's
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink").

There are no Lockers in the [Caverns](Cavern.md "wikilink").

## Common uses

Despite equipment being readily available from any [Equipment
terminal](Equipment_terminal.md "wikilink"), Lockers are still useful for
storing looted enemy equipment and ammo, equipping yourself when the
Facility is hacked or when the Facility's
[generator](generator.md "wikilink") is destroyed, or for Infiltration
resupply (Enemy Lockers are less conspicious to hack than enemy
Equipment Terminals).
