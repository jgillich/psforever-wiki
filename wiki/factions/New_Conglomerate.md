â€” New Conglomerate recruitment bulletin

## Introduction

The New Conglomerate is one of three
[Empires](../terminology/Empire.md) waging war on
[Auraxis](../locations/Auraxis.md). The basic philosophy of the New
Conglomerate is "hit them hard." What
their weapons lack in firing rate they make up for in pure damage.

The special ability of the New
Conglomerate
[MAXes](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) is their Shield,
providing a greater degree of protection over their standard armor.
