# Vanu Sovereignty

> The destiny of the human species tilts toward ruin. Thousands of years
of shortsightedness and provincial thinking have hampered its proper
evolution. We plunge toward oblivion. Those able to comprehend the
promise and potential of humanity will advance. They will usher the less
gifted through the gateway of understanding and cleanse the taint of
blindness, ignorance and mulishness from the species. We are the
shepherds of evolution, the harbingers of progress. We lead toward the
light.

â€” Vanu Sovereignty information brochure

## Introduction

The Vanu Sovereignty is one of three
[Empires](../terminology/Empire.md) waging war on
[Auraxis](../locations/Auraxis.md). Of the three, the Vanu
Sovereignty has most embraced the
technology of the [Ancients](../terminology/Ancients.md). Most of their
infantry weapons use [Energy Cells](../ammunition/Energy_Cell.md) instead of
conventional rounds. This provides provides flexibility in allowing most
weapons to have an anti-infantry and an armor-piercing mode without
having to change ammunition. All of the Vanu
Sovereignty's empire-specific weapons
launch energy instead of projectiles. These energy weapons cannot go
through water like conventional projectiles.

The Vanu Sovereignty's other
distinguishing characteristic is mobility. They boast the only vehicles
that boast [MagLev](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_levitation)
propulsion systems. By not using wheels, their vehicles can strafe
side-to-side and can also travel over water. The special ability of the
Vanu Sovereignty
[MAXes](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) is their Jump Jets,
allowing these units to jump over walls and other barriers.

The name Vanu is taken from the original name for the Ancients to show
their undying faith.
