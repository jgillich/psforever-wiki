To celebrate the Third Anniversary of
[PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md), an [Event](Event.md) was
held from May 19 to May 26, 2006.

This event was preceded by a series of [meteor](Meteor.md)
showers and earthquakes that were experienced across the different
[continents](Continent.md). Finally, on the first day of the
event, these messages began arriving.

## Messages from Military Command:

#### Message 1

On this eve of chaos, Military Command of each empire uploaded a similar
high priority message to all soldiers within their empires:

**_Attention Empire:_**

As you are no doubt aware, there has been an unusually high level of
seismic activity lately. The cause is unclear, but the situation is
being monitored closely.

It is believed that the anomalies we have witnessed cease to occur after
a certain time of day and we do not expect any further events today.

Additional information will follow as it becomes available but be on
high alert, as tomorrow is another day.

#### Message 2

This status message has been sent to soldiers of each empire from their
Military Command:

**_Attention Empire,_**

The Core has breached our central mainframe and has rewritten vital
portions of our replication procedures. The reasons for this attack - if
it is an attack - are unclear. Our engineers are trying to get the
situation under control, but for the moment the Core's reprogramming has
interfered with our ability to reconstruct some vehicle matrices.

Fortunately, it appears that our enemies are suffering the same
disruption, so while we are without some tools on the battlefield, we
should not be at a disadvantage.

Further information will be released as it becomes available.

#### Damage Report

Each empire has sent the following message to members of their empire:

Finally, it is over!

Our engineers have deduced how the Core breached our central mainframe,
and have strengthened our security to thwart further attacks.

We must now figure out how to undo the Core's damage. More information
will follow as resolutions are made.

Although we can celebrate ending the Core's intrusions, it wasn't
without loss: We are no longer able to construct the
[Lightning](Lightning.md), our strongest remaining assault
vehicle nor our assault [ATV](ATV.md)'s.

## Details

#### Vehicles

Because of problems with the mainframe, certain vehicles can no longer
be constructed for an unknown period of time.

So far, the following vehicles can no longer be constructed:

- [Sunderer](Sunderer.md)
- [BattleFrame Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics.md)
- [Vanguard](Vanguard.md)
- [Prowler](Prowler.md)
- [Magrider](Magrider.md)
- [Aurora](Aurora.md)
- [Thunderer](Thunderer.md)
- [Raider](Raider.md)
- [Enforcer](Enforcer.md)
- [Thresher](Thresher.md)
- [Marauder](Marauder.md)
- [Reaver](Reaver.md)
- [Liberator](Liberator.md)
- [Vulture](Vulture.md)
- [Mosquito](Mosquito.md)
- [Skyguard](Skyguard.md)
- [Switchblade](Switchblade.md)
- [Flail](Flail.md)
- [Fury](Fury.md)
- [Basilisk](Basilisk.md)
- [Lightning](Lightning.md)

Eventually, players received messages informing them that to restore
their lost [vehicles](Vehicle.md), they needed to capture
[cavern](Caverns.md) facilities to gain nanites. Everytime a
cavern locked, a status bar would reflect the change in recovery based
on how much they controlled. The vehicles that were removed last, were
restored first, and this process continued untill the vehicles first
removed ([BattleFrame Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics.md)) were
restored again.
