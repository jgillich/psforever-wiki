![](/images/Vanguard_threefourths.jpg "fig:Vanguard_threefourths.jpg")
[Vanguard](/Vanguard "wikilink") [Medium Battle
Tank](/Medium_Battle_Tank "wikilink").\]\] [Vehicles](/Vehicle "wikilink")
are an essential part to [PlanetSide](/PlanetSide "wikilink") as they are
the main mode of transport between [facilities](/facilities "wikilink")
and are the most powerful units on the battlefield. In PlanetSide, there
are many different types of vehicles, from mobile spawn points to huge
lumbering robots to ten person APC's.

Planetside currently has 38 different ground and air vehicles (not
including [HART](/HART "wikilink") shuttles and [Drop
Pods](/Drop_Pod "wikilink")), each with radically different attributes.
Almost every vehicle has at least one type of onboard weapons system -
the exceptions are the [AMS](/AMS "wikilink"), [ANT](/ANT "wikilink"),
[Lodestar](/Lodestar "wikilink"), [Phantasm](/Phantasm "wikilink"),
[Router](/Router "wikilink"), and [Wraith](/Wraith "wikilink") (though all
have important capabilities). Some vehicles are only available to
members of a particular [Empire](/Empire "wikilink"), while others are
available to all. Any unoccupied vehicle may be
[jacked](/jack "wikilink") (stolen) by an enemy [advanced
hacker](/Advanced_Hacking "wikilink").

## Acquiring a Vehicle

Acquiring a vehicle in PlanetSide is slightly more involved than in
other First Person Shooters. Not everyone is qualified to drive every
vehicle, and a player must first go through a slight process before
being able to acquire and drive a vehicle.

### Certifications

Before you can even get a vehicle, you must have the correct
[certification](/certification "wikilink"). Certain certifications yield
different vehicles, and while some of the certifications yield what
vehicle the certification name is, certain certifications come in
"bundles". Certain vehicles are also granted under multiple
certifications, so careful certification management is important when
applying for certain vehicles.

The list of vehicular certifications is as follows:

- [ATV](/ATV "wikilink")
  - [Switchblade](<Switchblade_(Certification)> "wikilink")
- [Harasser](/Harasser "wikilink")
- [Light Scout](/Light_Scout "wikilink")
- [Assault Buggy](<Assault_Buggy_(Certification)> "wikilink")
- [Armored Assault I](/Armored_Assault_I "wikilink")
  - [Armored Assault II](/Armored_Assault_II "wikilink")
    - [Flail](/Flail "wikilink")
    - [BattleFrame Robotics](/BattleFrame_Robotics "wikilink")
      - [BFR Anti-Infantry](/BFR_Anti-Infantry "wikilink")
      - [BFR Anti-Aircraft](/BFR_Anti-Aircraft "wikilink")
- [Ground Transport](/Ground_Transport "wikilink")
- [Ground Support](/Ground_Support "wikilink")
- [Air Cavalry, Scout](/Air_Cavalry_Scout "wikilink")
  - [Air Cavalry, Assault](/Air_Cavalry_Assault "wikilink") ([Light
    Scout](/Light_Scout "wikilink") can be used in place of Air
    Cavalry, Scout as a pre-requisite)
  - [Air Cavalry, Interceptor](/Air_Cavalry_Interceptor "wikilink")
    (Light Scout can be used in place of Air Cavalry, Scout as a
    pre-requisite)
- [Air Support](/Air_Support "wikilink")
  - [Galaxy Gunship](<Galaxy_Gunship_(Certification)> "wikilink")
- [Phantasm](<Phantasm_(Certification)> "wikilink") (requires
  [Infiltration Suit](<Infiltration_Suit_(Certification)> "wikilink"))

In addition, any player has access to the [Advanced Nanite
Transport](/Advanced_Nanite_Transport "wikilink").

### Merits

In addition to certifications, certain vehicles require the player to
have a certain [Merit Commendation](/Merit_Commendation "wikilink")
before they can be purchased or driven.

The vehicles and their requirements are listed below:

[Vulture](/Vulture "wikilink") : [Bomber Ace Bronze](/Bomber_Ace "wikilink")
Flight-Variant BFRs ([Invader](/Invader "wikilink"), [Eclipse](/Eclipse "wikilink"), or [Eagle](/Eagle "wikilink")) : [BFR Basic](<BFR_(Merit)> "wikilink")

### Vehicle Terminal

![](/images/NCmag.jpg "fig:NCmag.jpg") is a vehicle which requires a [Technology
Plant](/Technology_Plant "wikilink").\]\] Once a player has the correct
certification, a player can purchase the vehicle from a friendly or
hacked [Vehicle Terminal](/Vehicle_Terminal "wikilink"). However, some
Vehicle Terminals are restricted to either air or ground vehicles, and
some vehicles can only be purchased when certain requirements are met.
Also, after every vehicle purchase, the same vehicle cannot be purchased
for 5 minutes, unless you are at a base which has a [Vehicle
Module](/Vehicle_Module "wikilink"), in which the timer is reduced to
2:30.

In short, vehicles that are under [Air Cavalry
Scout](/Air_Cavalry_Scout "wikilink"), [Air Cavalry
Assault](/Air_Cavalry_Assault "wikilink"), the
[Liberator](/Liberator "wikilink") and the [Vulture](/Vulture "wikilink")
from [Air Support](/Air_Support "wikilink") and the
[Phantasm](/Phantasm "wikilink") can be purchased at Air Vehicle
Terminals. All of the above vehicles as well as the
[Galaxy](/Galaxy "wikilink"), [Galaxy Gunship](/Galaxy_Gunship "wikilink")
and [Lodestar](/Lodestar "wikilink") from [Air
Support](/Air_Support "wikilink") can be purchased at a Dropship Vehicle
Terminal. [BFR](/BFR "wikilink")'s can only be purchased at [BFR
Terminals](/BFR_Terminals "wikilink"). Any other vehicle can be purchased
from a Ground Vehicle Terminal.

However, there are still some other restrictions. Certain vehicles
require a [Technology Plant](/Technology_Plant "wikilink") to be able to
purchase them, and therefore require the player to either be at a
Technology Plant or have a friendly Technology Plant linked to the base
they are at through the lattice. An Empire's
[Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink") also counts as well. The vehicles that
are restricted by this are:

- [Reaver](/Reaver "wikilink")
- [Liberator](/Liberator "wikilink")
- [Vulture](/Vulture "wikilink")
- [Magrider](/Magrider "wikilink")
- [Vanguard](/Vanguard "wikilink")
- [Prowler](/Prowler "wikilink")
- [Skyguard](/Skyguard "wikilink")
- [Wasp](/Wasp "wikilink")
- [Phantasm](/Phantasm "wikilink")

Similarily, [Ancient Tech](/Ancient_Tech "wikilink") vehicles can only be
purchased at a base with a [Vehicle Module](/Vehicle_Module "wikilink")
installed or at a base which has a link to a friendly base with a
Vehicle Module installed. Alternately, these vehicles can always be
purchased in any of the six [Core Combat](/Core_Combat "wikilink")
[caverns](/cavern "wikilink"). The vehicles under this restriction are:

- [Switchblade](/Switchblade "wikilink")
- [Flail](/Flail "wikilink")

### Armor Requirements

Certain vehicles require the driver to be wearing a certain type of
armor. These are considered "closed cockpit vehicles" and only accept a
user wearing one of the following armor types as the driver:

- [Infiltration Suit](/Infiltration_Suit "wikilink")
- [Standard Exo-Suit](/Standard_Exo-Suit "wikilink")
- [Agile Exo-Suit](/Agile_Exo-Suit "wikilink")

Other vehicles have no such restriction, and allow the above armors as
well as a user wearing a [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](/Reinforced_Exo-Suit "wikilink") to be the driver. These are
considered "open cockpit vehicles". The "open cockpit vehicles" are:

- [Marauder](/Marauder "wikilink")
- [Thresher](/Thresher "wikilink")
- [Enforcer](/Enforcer "wikilink")
- [Skyguard](/Skyguard "wikilink")
- [Harasser](/Harasser "wikilink")
- [Fury](/Fury "wikilink")
- [Basilisk](/Basilisk "wikilink")
- [Wraith](/Wraith "wikilink")
- [Switchblade](/Switchblade "wikilink")
- [Router](/Router "wikilink")
- [Flail](/Flail "wikilink")
- [Leviathan](/Leviathan "wikilink")
- [Vindicator](/Vindicator "wikilink")
- [Juggernaut](/Juggernaut "wikilink")

All other vehicles are considered to be closed cockpit vehicles.

## Keymapping

In PlanetSide, a player has to be very careful when remapping keys for
vehicle controls. There are four pages for controls for vehicles, and it
is important to understand what each of them do before making mistakes
with your key bindings.

### Vehicle Controls

Vehicle controls are the keys that are used for all vehicles, regardless
of whether they are air or ground vehicles. The exception to this rule
is [BFR](/BFR "wikilink")'s, as they have their own key mapping and does
not use any of these key mappings.

These are the default Vehicle Controls.

### Ground Controls

These controls are for ground vehicles only. Ground vehicles use this
control set along with Vehicle Controls.

These are the default Ground Controls.

## Vehicle HUD Elements

When a player is inside of a vehicle, some new [HUD](/HUD "wikilink")
Elements show up. The Vehicle Armor Status icon defaults in the lower
left hand corner and shows up as an icon which represents your vehicle.
This slowly turns from green to red as your vehicle sustains damage.
Alternately, this can be turned into a simpler bar which becomes part of
the bottom toolbar on the HUD. With [BFR](/BFR "wikilink")'s, the icon
also gives the player a status on certain BFR subsystems, denoting their
damage through colors, either green, yellow, or red.

[BFR](/BFR "wikilink")'s and vehicles who had their shield generators
charged from an [Amp Station](/Amp_Station "wikilink")'s benefits have a
blue ring around their vehicle icon to show shield strength. Also, at
the same time, there is a blue bar at the bottom of the HUD on the
toolbar to denote shield strength as well.

After an [Advanced Nanite
Transport](/Advanced_Nanite_Transport "wikilink") has gone to a
[warpgate](/warpgate "wikilink") and gathered [NTU](/NTU "wikilink")'s, a
gray bar which reads "NTU Level" shows up on the bottom toolbar. This
denotes how many NTU's are stored on the ANT that are ready to be
transferred to an [NTU Silo](/NTU_Silo "wikilink") at a
[facility](/facility "wikilink"). Also, the
[Mosquito](/Mosquito "wikilink"), [Reaver](/Reaver "wikilink"),
[Vulture](/Vulture "wikilink"), [Galaxy](/Galaxy "wikilink"),
[Phantasm](/Phantasm "wikilink"), and [Lodestar](/Lodestar "wikilink") all
have [Afterburners](/Afterburner "wikilink"), which is denoted on the HUD
by a green bar which reads "Afterburners".

## Gunner and Passenger Spots

Most vehicles in [PlanetSide](/PlanetSide "wikilink") are not solo
vehicles; rather, they have gunner and passenger slots to make them more
teamwork-oriented. In any vehicle, if the driver or any of the gunners
scores a kill, the driver and the gunners in the vehicle are also
awarded [Experience](/Experience "wikilink"). Also, a gunner or a
passenger can always bail from a vehicle, while a driver may not
necessarily be able to.

### Gunner Slots

Gunner slots on a vehicle are denoted by a yellow circle around a Pistol
symbol. The owner of the vehicle can set who can get into a gunner
position using the Vehicle Management Pane. He can set the privacy to a
number of levels, including Empire, Squad, and Locked. All types of
Armor, besides [MAX](/MAX "wikilink") armor can get into a gunner slot,
regardless of the vehicle.

Gunners are the main way a vehicle gets kills. While the Driver is the
most important slot, generally a driver's weapons, if he has any at all,
are weaker than a gunner's weapons. Thus, it is important for the gunner
and the driver to coordinate to get the most kills. Also, many of the
best driver/gunner combinations use a Voice Over IP program such as
[Teamspeak](/Teamspeak "wikilink") or [Ventrilo](/Ventrilo "wikilink").

#### Merits Through Gunning

By gunning for a vehicle, a player can get certain merits. These merits
are as follows:

- [Ground Gunner](/Ground_Gunner "wikilink") (most ground vehicles)
- [Bombardier](<Bombardier_(Merit)> "wikilink") (Liberator and Vulture)
- [Air Defender](/Air_Defender "wikilink") (Skyguard)
- [Cavalry Pilot](/Cavalry_Pilot "wikilink") (Galaxy Gunship)

![](/images/Galaxy_Side.jpg "fig:Galaxy_Side.jpg") troop transport.\]\]

### Passenger Slots

Other vehicles operate as transport vehicles, and have passenger slots.
These spots on a vehicle are denoted by a yellow circle with a chair
inside it. Any armor besides [MAX](/MAX "wikilink") Armor can climb into
passenger slots and go for a ride. For new characters, this is probably
the easiest way to travel, as many new characters do not have the
[certification](/certification "wikilink") points required to acquire a
vehicle yet.

### MAX Passenger Slots

The [Leviathan](/Leviathan "wikilink"),
[Juggernaut](/Juggernaut "wikilink"),[Vindicator](/Vindicator "wikilink"),
and [Galaxy](/Galaxy "wikilink") have two positions which can be occupied
by players wearing [MAX](/MAX "wikilink") Armor. Players wearing a
[Infiltration Suit](/Infiltration_Suit "wikilink"), [Standard
Exo-Suit](/Standard_Exo-Suit "wikilink"), [Agile
Exo-Suit](/Agile_Exo-Suit "wikilink"), or a [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](/Reinforced_Exo-Suit "wikilink") may not utilze these spots on
a vehicle. These slots are denoted by a yellow circle with a MAX Icon in
the middle.

### Vehicle Bay

Both the [Galaxy](/Galaxy "wikilink") and the
[Lodestar](/Lodestar "wikilink") have a vehicle bay which can transport
smaller ground vehicles in the air. The [Galaxy](/Galaxy "wikilink") has
a much smaller vehicle bay and can therefore only transport certain
vehicles. These vehicles are:

- [Advanced Nanite Transport](/Advanced_Nanite_Transport "wikilink")
- [Basilisk](/Basilisk "wikilink")
- [Fury](/Fury "wikilink")
- [Wraith](/Wraith "wikilink")
- [Switchblade](/Switchblade "wikilink")
- [Harasser](/Harasser "wikilink")
- [Enforcer](/Enforcer "wikilink")
- [Marauder](/Marauder "wikilink")
- [Thresher](/Thresher "wikilink")
- [Skyguard](/Skyguard "wikilink")
- [Lightning](/Lightning "wikilink")

A [Lodestar](/Lodestar "wikilink") can carry any ground vehicle,
including [BFRs](/BFR "wikilink").

_Note: For a [Router](/Router "wikilink") to enter a
[Lodestar](/Lodestar "wikilink"), it must strafe into the Lodestar
sideways._
