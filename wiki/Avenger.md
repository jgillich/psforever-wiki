**Avenger**

The [Terran Republic](Terran_Republic.md) Variant of the
[One-Manned Field Turrets](One-Manned_Field_Turret.md), and is
deployed by use of the [Field Deployment
Unit](Field_Deployment_Unit.md). It is an adaptation of the
[Dual Cycler](Dual_Cycler.md) [MAX](MAX.md) weapon. The
rate of fire is similar to a locked-down Dual Cycler MAX. It has
unlimited ammunition, though it does have to reload after its clip has
been depleted.
