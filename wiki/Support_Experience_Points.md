**Support Experience** (**SEP**) went live in Patch
[3.7.3](/3.7.3 "wikilink") and is awarded for Kills that a Friendly
Soldier makes after you have Supported him. It is [Battle
Experience](/BEP "wikilink") awarded for Support activities. "Support"
includes:

- Repairing [armor](/armor "wikilink") (infantry or vehicles) that then
  scores kills
- Repairing any kind of [turret](/turret "wikilink") that then score
  kills
- Healing damage to a soldier that then scores kills
- Reviving a dead soldier that then scores kills
- Hacking an [Equipment Terminal](/Equipment_Terminal "wikilink"),
  [locker](/locker "wikilink"), [Vehicle
  Terminal](/Vehicle_Terminal "wikilink") or [Medical
  Terminal](/Medical_Terminal "wikilink") that soldiers use and then
  score kills
- Owning an [AMS](/AMS "wikilink") that soldiers spawn or equip at and
  then score kills
- Piloting a [Galaxy](/Galaxy "wikilink"), [Galaxy
  Gunship](/Galaxy_Gunship "wikilink"), or
  [Phantasm](/Phantasm "wikilink") and dropping troops that then score
  kills
- Owning a deployed [router](/router "wikilink") or placing a
  [telepad](/telepad "wikilink") that soldiers use and then score kills
- Owning a [lodestar](/lodestar "wikilink") that
  [vehicles](/vehicle "wikilink") either repair or rearm at and then
  score kills

Unlike base capture or kill [BEP](/BEP "wikilink"), you will not be
notified immediately on receiving Support Experience. Instead, you will
receive occasional messages in your chat box about your "Support
Activity". This experience is considered to be BEP when it is rewarded.

Also, note that SEP is included in your BEP total. It is displayed
separately to allow you to see how effective your support has been.
