**PlanetSide Reserves** was a program that ran from March 24, 2006 to
March 27, 2007. It offered a limited version of
[PlanetSide](/PlanetSide "wikilink") without a monthly fee. Characters
were limited in [Battle Rank](/Battle_Rank "wikilink") and [Command
Rank](/Command_Rank "wikilink"), and the program was set to end March 24, 2007. When that date arrived, Reserves players were still able to log in
and play, and new Reserves accounts could still be created, but on March
27, the program was ended.

In conjunction with the launch of the PlanetSide Reserves, all paying
accounts received access to [AfterShock](/AfterShock "wikilink") content.
