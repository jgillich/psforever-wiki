**HART**, or **High Altitude Rapid Transport** shuttle, is a large
passenger spacecraft that makes regular flights at three minute
intervals to any of the ten [planets](planet.md "wikilink") and their
[continents](continent.md "wikilink"). Landing and departing from special
platform hangars ([HART buildings](HART_building.md "wikilink")) in each
[Empire](Empire.md "wikilink")'s [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink").

Boarding a HART will present you with a [Interstellar
Map](Interstellar_Map.md "wikilink") where you can select your launch
destination; you will then descend via [Drop Pod](Drop_Pod.md "wikilink")
to the target you selected.

If you opt to drop into a [Poplocked](Population_lock.md "wikilink")
[planet](planet.md "wikilink"), you will be entered in a
[queue](Warp_queue.md "wikilink"), and you will automatically drop when a
position becomes open.

To disembark a HART before it departs, press the use key (default G),
you will appear outside of the HART doors in your
[sanctuary](sanctuary.md "wikilink"). You can "bail" (default key: alt+G)
from the HART once the vehicle clears the hangar, skipping the rest of
the launch animation, and enabling you to select a drop location faster.
