Resonance Crystals are small crystals implanted in the spinal cord of
any soldier. These crystals are activated by the [BFR
Imprint](BFR_Imprint.md) process, and allow a soldier to pilot a
[BFR](BattleFrame_Robotics.md).

These crystals resonate the thought patterns of a soldier after having
time to "tune into" the soldier's thought patterns. This allowed BFR
pilots to properly pilot BFRs, having the system connect directly to
this crystal, and inquire it for reactions that the soldier themselves
would often give to that situation.

During the initial process of imprinting on these crystals, many
soldiers complained of hearing voices in their heads. However, many of
them also went hysterical when a scientist attempted to remove their
crystals, afraid to let go of the most positive voice they've had in
their head. After all, who agrees with everything you say and think more
than yourself?
