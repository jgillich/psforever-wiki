**Markov** was the PlanetSide server that was located on the western
coast of the United States (San Diego, California). It was merged with
the [Emerald](Emerald "wikilink") server to create the
[Gemini](Gemini "wikilink") server on May 20, 2008.

**Markov's** characterbase was a combination of characters from Markov
as well as the shut down [Johari](Johari "wikilink") server.

Characters who came from [Johari](Johari "wikilink") whose names were
already in use on **Markov** had a "-J" appended to the end of their
names. These names transfer to Gemini. If another character already
existed on Emerald before the server merge and had priority over the
Markov name, a "-M" was appended to the end of the Markov's character
name. [Outfit](Outfit "wikilink") names followed a similar rule. See
[Gemini](Gemini "wikilink") for more information on character and outfit
naming rules and how to change them if they have a "-M" or "-E"
appended.
