**Colossus 100mm Cannon Shells**

These shells are used by the [Dual 100mm
Cannons](Dual_100mm_Cannons.md) on the
[Colossus](Colossus.md), which is the anti-armor gunner weapon.
The weapon is almost identical to the 100mm cannons on the
[Prowler](Prowler.md), though it does much less damage to
infantry. The boxes can be obtained from any [Equipment
Terminal](Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
[vehicle](vehicle.md)'s [trunk](trunk.md) or acquired
while in the vehicle from a [Repair/Rearm.md
Silo](Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
