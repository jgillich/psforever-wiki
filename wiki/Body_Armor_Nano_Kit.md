**Body Armor Nano Kit (BANK)**

The [Body Armor Nano Kit](Body_Armor_Nano_Kit.md) (BANK) allows
for the field repair of all armor classes. The
[BANK](Body_Armor_Nano_Kit.md) has two settings. The primary
mode is used for repairing other players; the secondary mode allows for
the self-repair of the user.

## New Player Advice

1.  Carrying a BANK around will guarantee that you make friends in the
    field. Everyone loves an armor touch up. Just remember to pack an
    extra [Armor Canister](Armor_Canister.md) or two.
2.  When repairing, allow the person you're repairing to stand in front
    of you. This will allow him to "protect" you from damage, meaning
    that you might both survive a sneak attack.

- Additionally, crouching further reduces your chances of being hit,
  especially when behind a
  [MAX](Mechanized_Armored_Exo-Suit.md).

1.  Whenever possible, repair any
    [MAX](Mechanized_Armored_Exo-Suit.md) unit you see.
