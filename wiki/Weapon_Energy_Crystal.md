Weapon Crystals restore energy to the [Core
Combat](/Core_Combat "wikilink") Ancient Tech weapons:
[Radiator](/Radiator "wikilink"), [Spiker](/Spiker "wikilink"), and
[Maelstrom](/Maelstrom "wikilink"). To recharge the weapon, simply stand
close to the crystal. The weapon will recharge as long as it is in a
[holster](/holster "wikilink") (you do not have to have the weapon
actually drawn to recharge...it will recharge even if you are dead!).
Before the introduction of AT weapon clips, this was the only way to
restore weapon energy in the caverns. However, even then their usage was
limited.
