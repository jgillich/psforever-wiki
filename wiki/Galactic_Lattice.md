Refers to the links between [continents](/continent "wikilink") and
[planets](/planet "wikilink") in the
[Post-Bending](/The_Bending "wikilink") [Auraxis](/Auraxis "wikilink").
Similar to the [Continental Lattice](/Lattice "wikilink"), the **Galactic
Lattice** allows [Empires](/Empire "wikilink") to teleport from planet to
planet, or to the caverns, via [warpgates](/warpgate "wikilink"),
[broadcast warpgates](/broadcast_warpgate "wikilink"), and
[geowarps](/geowarp "wikilink").

The Galactic Lattice is viewable from the [Interstellar
Map](/Interstellar_Map "wikilink").

## History of the Galactic Lattice

The Galactic Lattice has undergone three major revisions from its
original configuration.

### Launch (May, 2003)

Auraxis was originally presented as being a single planet. Each Empire
had three home continents, with [Searhus](/Searhus "wikilink") being the
only continent not directly linked to any
[Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink"). The introduction of [Core
Combat](/Core_Combat "wikilink") did not significantly change this, only
added the rotating Geowarps in order to provide access to the Caverns.
The links between warpgates on each continent are fixed. Except for the
[HART](/HART "wikilink"), there is no way to get to a continent except by
moving through any intervening continents.

### The Bending

With "The Bending", Auraxis is split up into 13 "planets" and six
"asteroids" on which the continents and caverns now reside. At the same
time, the continent of [Oshur](/Oshur "wikilink") is broken up into four
[Battle Islands](/Battle_Islands "wikilink"). It is at this point that
the Galactic Lattice came into existence. Additionally, while warpgate
connections are generally fixed, if an Empire can capture a continent,
all warpgates on that continent will become [Broadcast
warpgates](/Broadcast_warpgate "wikilink"), providing instant access to
continents/planets that are normally several hops away.

Additionally, Empires no longer have any home continents, and all
warpgates on their Sanctuary are broadcast warpgates. Because of the
geometry of connecting the continents, some warpgates became inactive.

### One Home Planet

Due to overwhelming community calls for a "home turf" to defend, the
Lattice is changed again to give each Empire a single home planet
(continent). The functionality for Broadcast warpgates remains
essentially the same, but now each Sanctuary is "hardwired" to one of
the planets.

### Two Home Planets

The Lattice was changed again to its current configuration of two home
planets and inter-planet links were again shuffled around. Additionally,
the Broadcast Warpgate functionality was changed. Now, instead of
needing to hold the [Capitol](/Capitol "wikilink") facility on the
planet, an Empire needs to control the [planetary
lattice](/Lattice "wikilink") links between warpgates for them to be
broadcast warpgates. This also has a beneficial side effect in allowing
zones without Capitols (Oshur Battle Islands, Caverns) to be able to
have broadcast warpgates.

### Home Planet Rotation

To give players a change in gameplay, the Lattice was changed once more.
All home planets were rotated to a different empire, changing the links
to each planet. The [Vanu Sovereignty](/Vanu_Sovereignty "wikilink")
acquired [Forseral](/Forseral "wikilink") and
[Ceryshen](/Ceryshen "wikilink"), the [Terran
Republic](/Terran_Republic "wikilink") was granted
[Solsar](/Solsar "wikilink") and [Hossin](/Hossin "wikilink"), and the
[New Conglomerate](/New_Conglomerate "wikilink") was given
[Amerish](/Amerish "wikilink") and [Esamir](/Esamir "wikilink"). This was
done so that each empire can experience battles from a different
perspective.
