**Deconstructing** refers to one of two things:

1.  When a player [Recalls](/Recall "wikilink"), calls [Instant
    Action](/Instant_Action "wikilink"), enters a [Respawn
    tube](/Respawn_tube "wikilink"), or accesses an
    [AMS's](/Advanced_Mobile_Station "wikilink") [Respawn
    panel](/Respawn_panel "wikilink") and dematerializes in a cloud of
    green nanite dust.
    - To deconstruct, simply approach one of the above areas and press
      the "G" key when prompted to deconstruct.
2.  When a game object dematerializes in a cloud of green nanite dust.
    The occasions for this to happen vary.
    - Destroyed vehicles dematerializing after a time to clear
      roadways and lines of fire.
    - Auto-deconstruction of a vehicle too close to an exterior
      doorway, restricted ground, [vehicle
      pad](/Vehicle_Terminal "wikilink"), or
      [zipline](/zipline "wikilink").
    - Auto-deconstruction of a vehicle that has lost ownership. This
      occurs five minutes after ownership is lost
      ([AMSes](/AMS "wikilink") have a 15 minute timer)
    - Dematerializing of objects, such as
      [backpacks](/backpack "wikilink"), in areas of heavy population
      or activity to reduce lag.
    - Manual deconstruction of a vehicle by the player from their
      [vehicle](/vehicle "wikilink") management window.
