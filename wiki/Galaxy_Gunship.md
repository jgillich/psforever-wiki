**Galaxy Gunship**

The Galaxy Gunship is a modified [Galaxy](Galaxy "wikilink") airframe
with heavy guns, and more armor. The gunship takes only 75% of all
damage incident on it, making its effective armor much stronger than the
regular Galaxy without increasing repair time much.

The gunship sports three 35mm chainguns and 2 [Ground
Pounders](Ground_Pounder "wikilink"). It lacks the [MAX](MAX "wikilink")
passenger slots and cargo bay of the original Galaxy. The Galaxy Gunship
is a beast on the battlefield, able to take on almost any single target
at close to medium range. A single anti-aircraft platform is no match
for the gunship.

The Galaxy Gunship can only be purchased at a [Dropship
Center](Dropship_Center "wikilink") or the
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink"). The purchase timer is 10 minutes.
