## Description

The planet housing Ishundar is largely characterized by the
high-altitude continuous sandstorm that carries in the turbulent upper
atmosphere, giving a corona to the sun and constantly raining grit down
upon those on the planet's surface.

This continent is extremely arid and inhospitable to life. Its saltwater
lakes are the only break in the unending bleakness that is Ishundar.

The surface of the continent is extremely rough, making off-roading a
challenge and making roadways something of a predictable path for
convoys.

The continent is split in two by a gigantic canyon valley between the
two highlands in Ishundar's center, making traffic flows between the two
halves more predictable and creating bottlenecks for tacticians to
exploit.
