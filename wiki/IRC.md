## Get a Client

Try [our in-browser java irc
client](http://comms.planetsidesyndicate.com/irc/index.html).

Or you can download mIRC for free from [1](http://www.mirc.com). Once
installed you can fill out your username information and continue below:

## To Connect

If you have mIRC installed you can click
[this](irc://irc.forthegamers.org:6667/planetside) link and it will
connect you.

OR

type

`/server irc.uohost.net`

alternate server names are irc.unrealgamers.net and
irc.synergygaming.com

NOTE: worldgamers.net is no longer pointed to the correct network.
Please update your settings to irc.forthegamers.org

## Once Connected

To join a channel to chat, use command /join. Our most popular channels
are #planetside and #srn. For example, type

`/join #planetside`

to join the #planetside room.

### Registering

Once connected you can register yourself to the server by typing

`/register `<account>` `<password>` `<email>

then the next time you visit type

`/auth `<account>` `<password>

### Personal Messages

To send personal messages (called queries) use the command /query with
their name (and optionally a message). For example, to say hello to
martyr, you would type (in any irc room)

`/msg martyr hello`

## Notes on the Java client

The java client requires [Sun's Java browser
plug-in](http://www.sun.com/java).

This client works in Firefox and Mozilla browsers, Opera, Safari,
Konquerer, and even Internet Explorer (although the Syndicate does not
condone its use in any circumstance).

It automatically connects to our server first, and then channel
#planetside. The first window that opens, called "Status," is the status
of your connection to the server. This window is handy for executing
private commands that you wouldn't want another room to see (if you
leave out the leading /, for example), such as sending queries to other
people.

Once the connection is made, the window for #planetside automatically
opens.
