_This article is about the game's tracking method for support players to
count towards Support Merit Commendations. To see the Idealab concept
with ASSIST as an acronym, see [Advanced Service and Supply Infantry
Support
Tool](Advanced_Service_and_Supply_Infantry_Support_Tool.md "wikilink")._

[Assists](Assist.md "wikilink") are [Planetside](Planetside.md "wikilink")'s
method for tracking [Support Experience
Points](Support_Experience_Points.md "wikilink") and how support character
gain [Merits](Merit_Commendation.md "wikilink"). An assist is awarded after
a player that you supported scores a kill. This is denoted on the
[HUD](HUD.md "wikilink") on the Session Stats Bar with an "A: ". Assists
are also gained by operating a vehicle that has gunners or bombardiers
that are making kills using your vehicles weaponry.

[Support](Support.md "wikilink") activities include healing, repairing,
hacking, and other helpful activities. An assist timer will start after
the first kill the person you supported makes. Any additional kills
during this time will also count as assists. This timer is a minimum of
5 minutes and a maximum of 10 minutes, depending how much you supported
the player. If the player dies, the tracker stops, unless he is
[revived](revive.md "wikilink"). [Locker Hack](Locker_Hack.md "wikilink") and
[hot drop](Galaxy_Support_Pilot.md "wikilink") assist timers start at the
time of the assist, rather than after the first kill.

When a support-related assist is scored, a certain amount of the [Battle
Experience Points](Battle_Experience_Points.md "wikilink") that the
supported player scored for the kill is returned back to the supporter
in what is called [Support Experience
Points](Support_Experience_Points.md "wikilink"). The amount of BEP
returned to the supporter is dependent on how much you supported them,
the more you supported them, the more SEP you receive. Note that "kills"
on deployables and [Wall Turrets](Wall_Turret.md "wikilink") will count as
an assist on the HUD, but only player kills will count toward merits and
give SEP.
