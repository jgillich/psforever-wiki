Version 3.6.8, released May 17, 2005.

## Features

On May 19, 2005, PlanetSide celebrates its 2nd Year Anniversary. This
anniversary brings two special rewards for the community. A Two Year
Term of Service Merit and a Heavy Sniper Rifle.

- [Two Year Term of Service Merit](Term_of_Service.md "wikilink") - This
  merit is granted to characters that have been in creation for two
  years.
- [Heavy Sniper Rifle](Heavy_Scout_Rifle.md "wikilink") - The Heavy
  Sniper Rifle is a powerful alternative to the Bolt Driver for
  snipers. It uses high-caliber "bolt" ammunition like the Bolt
  Driver, but holds a ten-shot clip and can be fired much more
  rapidly, albeit with a significant penalty to accuracy. All three
  empires have chosen to make this weapon available to all soldiers
  with at least two years of service.
