The Ballgun is found on all the [Empire](Empire.md)-specific
Sunderer variants: [Leviathan](Leviathan.md),
[Juggernaut](Juggernaut.md), and
[Vindicator](Vindicator.md). They are mounted on the sides of
the vehicle intended to be anti-infantry weapons. The viewing area is
small, but if the user has the [Darklight](Darklight.md)
[Implant](Implants.md) enabled,
[cloaked](Infiltration_Suit.md) enemies are visible at a longer
range than would be possible with the implant alone.
