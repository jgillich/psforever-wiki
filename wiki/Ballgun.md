The Ballgun is found on all the [Empire](Empire.md "wikilink")-specific
Sunderer variants: [Leviathan](Leviathan.md "wikilink"),
[Juggernaut](Juggernaut.md "wikilink"), and
[Vindicator](Vindicator.md "wikilink"). They are mounted on the sides of
the vehicle intended to be anti-infantry weapons. The viewing area is
small, but if the user has the [Darklight](Darklight.md "wikilink")
[Implant](Implant.md "wikilink") enabled,
[cloaked](Infiltration_Suit.md "wikilink") enemies are visible at a longer
range than would be possible with the implant alone.
