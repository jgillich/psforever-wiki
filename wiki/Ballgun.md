The Ballgun is found on all the [Empire](/Empire "wikilink")-specific
Sunderer variants: [Leviathan](/Leviathan "wikilink"),
[Juggernaut](/Juggernaut "wikilink"), and
[Vindicator](/Vindicator "wikilink"). They are mounted on the sides of
the vehicle intended to be anti-infantry weapons. The viewing area is
small, but if the user has the [Darklight](/Darklight "wikilink")
[Implant](/Implant "wikilink") enabled,
[cloaked](/Infiltration_Suit "wikilink") enemies are visible at a longer
range than would be possible with the implant alone.
