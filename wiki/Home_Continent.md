A [Home Continent](Home_Continent.md "wikilink") (or Home Planet in the
[Post-Bending](The_Bending.md "wikilink") era) is simply a
[planet](planet.md "wikilink"), or [continent](continent.md "wikilink") which
possesses a link to an [Empire](Empire.md "wikilink")'s
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink"). By link it is implied that this
connection cannot be severed, as in the Sanctuary contains a
[warpgate](warpgate.md "wikilink") which leads directly to that planet
without needing to broadcast there. Patch [3.12.28](3.md.12.28 "wikilink")
(July 31, 2007) changed the Home Continents of each empire. The current
Empire Home Continents are

[Vanu Sovereignty](Vanu_Sovereignty.md "wikilink"):
[Ceryshen](Ceryshen.md "wikilink") & [Forseral](Forseral.md "wikilink")

[Terran Republic](Terran_Republic.md "wikilink"):
[Solsar](Solsar.md "wikilink") & [Hossin](Hossin.md "wikilink")

[New Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate.md "wikilink"):
[Esamir](Esamir.md "wikilink") & [Amerish](Amerish.md "wikilink")

Historically the VS had Esamir and Amerish, the TR had Ceryshen and
Forseral, and the NC had Solsar and Hossin.
