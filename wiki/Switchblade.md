**Switchblade**

The Switchblade is an [Ancient
Technology](/Ancient_Technology "wikilink") based vehicle which has a
fairly heavy amount of armor, but its firepower depends on whether it is
in the deployed or undeployed mode. It travels at a speed similar to
that of an [ATV](/ATV "wikilink") with its Scythe energy weapon firing at
a fairly slow rate, with the weapon's movement independent of the
vehicle being limited to only a vertical plane, but when deployed it
acts as a turret with a an extremely rapid rate of fire and the weapon
being able to fire to the same degree on the vertical plane, but also
able to fire fully on the horizontal plane. While terrain and vehicles
stop the Scythe weapon projectile (like every other weapon), infantry do
not. This means that the weapon can hurt infantry standing behind the
first infantry target, enabling the Switchblade to devastate tight
clusters of infantry. The Switchblade can also strafe side to side and
travel over water (but cannot deploy on water).

The main drawback is the switchblade goes through ammo quickly. Unlike
other vehicles, you can only get more ammo by going to a [Repair/Rearm
Silo](/Repair/Rearm_Silo "wikilink") at a facility with a [Vehicle
Module](/Vehicle_Module "wikilink") benefit, or if you are in the
[caverns](/caverns "wikilink"), at a [Vehicle Energy
Crystal](/Vehicle_Energy_Crystal "wikilink").
