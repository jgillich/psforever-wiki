![](Drop-pod.md.jpg "fig:Drop-pod.jpg") Drop pods are atmospheric reentry
capsules for individual troop deployment.

Using atmospheric drag and retrorockets, one pod is capable of carrying
any armor class up through [MAX](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md), but not vehicles.

Accessible via the [HART](HART.md), a soldier can land a drop
pod on any relatively flat ground outside of an [SOI](Sphere_of_Influence.md)
(noting that the SOI covers the entirety of a [continent
locked](continental_lock.md) by that empire).
