![](/Drop-pod.jpg "fig:Drop-pod.jpg") Drop pods are atmospheric reentry
capsules for individual troop deployment.

Using atmospheric drag and retrorockets, one pod is capable of carrying
any armor class up through [MAX](/MAX "wikilink"), but not vehicles.

Accessible via the [HART](/HART "wikilink"), a soldier can land a drop
pod on any relatively flat ground outside of an [SOI](/SOI "wikilink")
(noting that the SOI covers the entirety of a [continent
locked](/continental_lock "wikilink") by that empire).
