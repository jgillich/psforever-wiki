**Lasher**

The [Lasher](Lasher.md "wikilink") is the [Heavy
Assault](Heavy_Assault.md "wikilink") weapon of the [Vanu
Sovereignty](Vanu_Sovereignty.md "wikilink"). It quickly fires energy orbs
which do significant damage on contact, as well as "Lashing" (When an
orb brushes by the target) nearby enemy targets for minor damage. The
orbs travel fairly quickly (as of patch [3.15.29](3.md.15.29 "wikilink"))
but suffer from [damage degradation](Damage_Degradation.md "wikilink") at
longer ranges. Enemies closer than 5 meters from the shooter will not be
lashed by near misses. Friendly units are immune to the lash effect at
all ranges, though they will still take damage upon direct hits. The
near miss lash does low damage on its own and is best used for
discovering [cloakers](cloaker.md "wikilink") and making the enemy's
[COF](COF.md "wikilink") bloom from the damage. However, it is still strong
enough to make many enemies retreat if they are hiding behind a wall and
is especially effective in groups of users.

The secondary [Armor Piercing](Armor_Piercing.md "wikilink") fire mode is
best used against [MAXes](MAX.md "wikilink") and light
[vehicles](vehicle.md "wikilink"). This mode lacks the lash effect and the
orbs are colored purple.

A non-native user will be unable to obtain the energy ammunition from
equipment terminals.

Shots to kill (With direct orb contact within 20m.):
