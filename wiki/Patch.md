A **patch** is an update to the game automatically downloaded by the
[game client software](Client.md "wikilink"). They are installed by [Launch
Pad](Launch_Pad.md "wikilink") and apply changes to the currently installed
game files. Patches are either to fix bugs or add new features, often
both. Occasionally a patch will be used to "rollback" a feature. This is
rare and done only when something is very broken and needs to be
re-done.
