Installing this [module](modules.md "wikilink") provides the [module
benefit](module_benefit.md "wikilink") of allowing the purchase, repair,
and capacitor recharging of [Ancient-Tech](Ancient-Tech.md "wikilink")
vehicles: [Flail](Flail.md "wikilink") and
[Switchblade](Switchblade.md "wikilink"). The vehicles can repair at the
[Repair/Rearm.md Silo](Repair/Rearm_Silo.md "wikilink") and can recharge their
capacitors at either [Landing Pads](Landing_Pad.md "wikilink") or
Repair/rearm.md silos. Additionally, the vehicle reacquire timer for all
vehicles is reduced significantly.

Note that though the [Router](Router.md "wikilink") is considered an
[Ancient-Tech](Ancient-Tech.md "wikilink") vehicle, it does not require a
Vehicle Module to be acquired.

This module appears as purple on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink").
