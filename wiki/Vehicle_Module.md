Installing this [module](modules.md) provides the [module
benefit](module_benefit.md) of allowing the purchase, repair,
and capacitor recharging of [Ancient-Tech](Ancient_Technology.md)
vehicles: [Flail](Flail.md) and
[Switchblade](Switchblade.md). The vehicles can repair at the
[Repair/Rearm Silo](Repair_Rearm_Silo.md) and can recharge their
capacitors at either [Landing Pads](Landing_Pad.md) or
Repair/Rearm Silos. Additionally, the vehicle reacquire timer for all
vehicles is reduced significantly.

Note that though the [Router](Router.md) is considered an
[Ancient-Tech](Ancient_Technology.md) vehicle, it does not require a
Vehicle Module to be acquired.

This module appears as purple on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md).
