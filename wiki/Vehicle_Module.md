Installing this [module](/modules "wikilink") provides the [module
benefit](/module_benefit "wikilink") of allowing the purchase, repair,
and capacitor recharging of [Ancient-Tech](/Ancient-Tech "wikilink")
vehicles: [Flail](/Flail "wikilink") and
[Switchblade](/Switchblade "wikilink"). The vehicles can repair at the
[Repair/Rearm Silo](/Repair/Rearm_Silo "wikilink") and can recharge their
capacitors at either [Landing Pads](/Landing_Pad "wikilink") or
repair/rearm silos. Additionally, the vehicle reacquire timer for all
vehicles is reduced significantly.

Note that though the [Router](/Router "wikilink") is considered an
[Ancient-Tech](/Ancient-Tech "wikilink") vehicle, it does not require a
Vehicle Module to be acquired.

This module appears as purple on the [Continental
Map](/Continental_Map "wikilink").
