**Sensor Disruptor**

The Sensor Disruptor is available to players certed in both [Advanced
Hacking](Advanced_Hacking.md) and [Combat
Engineering](Combat_Engineering.md). It is deployed by use of
the [Adaptive Construction
Engine](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md) (ACE) in its Quaternary
Mode, and then using the "Change Ammo" function.

Once deployed, the Sensor Disruptor will block all friendly soldiers and
equipment within 30 meters from showing up on any form of enemy radar.
It can not be deployed on buildings or inside an enemy courtyard, but
can be placed within an enemy [SOI](SOI.md).

The Sensor Disruptor is indicated by a big yellow circle on the mini-map
as well as on the continental map. As with all deployables, double
clicking on it on the continental map will give you a pop-up asking if
you wish to deconstruct it.
