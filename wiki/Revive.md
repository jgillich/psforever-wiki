A [revive](revive.md "wikilink") allows a soldier whose
[health](health.md "wikilink") has hit 0 to be brought back into combat
without the need of being [respawned](respawn.md "wikilink"). This allows
for a soldier to get back into the combat more quickly, and it also
allows a soldier to avoid having his respawn time lengethening due to
frequent deaths. However, a soldier who is revived has the same
[stamina](stamina.md "wikilink") and armor as when they died, so often, a
soldier's armor needs to be repaired and the soldier needs to rest for
awhile to regain their stamina.

To revive a fallen comrade, a player needs the [Advanced
Medical](Advanced_Medical.md "wikilink")
[certification](certification.md "wikilink") along with a [Medical
Applicator](Medical_Applicator.md "wikilink"). Reviving someone takes 25
units of ammo from a [Health Canister](Health_Canister.md "wikilink") and
takes several seconds. During this period, the Medic is vulnerable to
attack, so other players should attempt to cover a medic who is trying
to revive someone.

When trying to revive a player, the Advanced Medic needs to be close
enough so that the "Corpse of" dialogue comes up underneath the reticle.
Also, when pointing the Medical Applicator at the ground, the "Corpse
of" dialogue needs to show up to be able to revive the player.
Generally, the area around the feet is the easiest area to find the
"Corpse of" dialogue.
