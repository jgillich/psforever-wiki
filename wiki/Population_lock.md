A Population lock means that an [Empire](/Empire "wikilink") has filled
all available server slots to capacity for a
[continent](/continent "wikilink"). Total capacity for each world is
figured to be roughly 500-550 players.

If a continent is [pop locked](/Acronyms_and_Slang "wikilink"), any
player warping to the planet via a [warpgate](/warpgate "wikilink") or
[broadcast warpgate](/broadcast_warpgate "wikilink") will enter the [warp
queue](/warp_queue "wikilink") until such time as server slots are freed
up.

Each Empire is currently allowed roughly 133 troops per continent, or 13
full [squads](/squad "wikilink").

Population Lock status can be viewed from the [Interstellar
Map](/Interstellar_Map "wikilink") as a padlock symbol on one of the side
windows.

## Game History

During the year of 2003, population capacity was not evenly split
between Empires. Each side could potentially fill up nearly two-thirds
of the slots, leaving one-third to split between the other two factions.
It became standard practice for an empire to rush a continent to
capacity to gain a permenant number advantage over the opposition.

During the year of 2004, population capacity was evenly divided between
each faction, allowing roughly \~166 troops per side to fill a
continent.

For 2005, population capacity was reduced to its current \~133 per side
per continent, this created the side effect of more fights across the
galaxy.
