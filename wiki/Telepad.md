**Telepad**

The [Telepad](Telepad.md "wikilink") is not available through the standard
[Equipment terminal](Equipment_terminal.md "wikilink"), but must be
obtained from a deployed [Router](Router.md "wikilink").

The Telepad then allows front-line troops to create an instantaneous
two-way [Teleporter](Teleporter.md "wikilink") between the point where the
Telepad is placed, and it's linked [Router](Router.md "wikilink").

The Telepad is placed on the ground, and then takes one minute to
activate, upon which the link is formed. Once active, the telepad can be
destroyed by any weapon by hitting the largest telepad fragment at the
top. It must be placed where there is room for a soldier to materialise,
and has a range of 300m -- about the distance from
[Tower](Tower.md "wikilink") to Base Spawn Room. Telepads also have an
interference range similar to that of an [AMS](AMS.md "wikilink"), thus
another telepad cannot be placed close to an already active one. Like
other deployables, a telepad placed by you can be deconstructed by
double clicking on its icon on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink") and selecting to deconstruct it.

The link is not IFF Aware, so enemy troops may travel back through the
link from the Telepad to the Router. If the host
[Router](Router.md "wikilink") is hacked, the deployed telepad is
destroyed.
