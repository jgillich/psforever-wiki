The **Surge** Implant provides a marked increase in footspeed for
infantry, at the expense of stamina. The stamina usage is dependent on
the current armor bulk.

Activating the Surge Implant will automatically holster the currently
drawn weapon, and drawing a weapon will deactivate the Surge Implant.

Primarily useful for sprints from cover to cover, across open ground, or
for dashing past entrenched defenders in [Towers](Tower.md) or
[Back Door](Back_Door.md) Corridors.
