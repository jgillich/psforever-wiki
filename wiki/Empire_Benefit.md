[Locking](Continental_lock.md) a continent can carry with it a
unique benefit for the Empire holding that [planet](planet.md).
These benefits apply to all facilities regardless of a [Galactic
Lattice](Galactic_Lattice.md) link.

There are currently two types of [continents](continent.md),
[Home Continents](Home_Continent.md) and [Neutral
Continents](Neutral_Continent.md).

## Home continents

A Home Continent is on a planet directly linked to an Empire's
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md). If an Empire captures both of these
planets, they gain access to that Empire's vehicles. A linked
[Technology Plant](Technology_Plant.md) is still required to
purchase [Advanced Assault
vehicles](Advanced_Assault_vehicles.md).

Home Continent Empire benefits persist until an opposing Empire
recaptures and locks one of their home continents.

## Neutral continents

A Neutral Continent/Planet is not linked to any Sanctuaries. There are
currently 4 neutral planets. When an Empire locks one, they will gain
the benefit associated with it. These benefits persist until an opposing
Empire recaptures and locks the continent for their own faction.

[Searhus](Searhus.md) : Provides the [Bio Laboratory](Bio_Laboratory.md) benefit to all of your bases. (i.e., faster respawn)

These benefits are sometimes called Global Benefits.
