There are ten battle continents in Planetside: six [Home
Continents](Home_Continent.md) and four [Neutral
Continents](Neutral_Continent.md). Capturing these continents
are the main object of the war. [Pre-Bending](The_Bending.md)
these continents were located on a single planet called Auraxis, but
ever since the event the continents have been pushed out to exist on ten
seperate [planets](Planet.md).

Capturing, or [locking](Continental_lock.md), a type of
continent can provide certain benefits for each Empire depending on its
[Home](Home_Continent.md) or
[Neutral](Neutral_Continent.md) status.

A continent can be reached by traveling through the
[warpgates](Warpgate.md) or [broadcast
warpgates](broadcast_warpgate.md), and via the [HART
Shuttle](HART.md) system located in each Empire's
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md). It can also be reached by selecting
[Instant Action](Instant_Action.md) from your Esc
[Menu](Menu.md).

Each Continent can be viewed from the
[Interstellar](Interstellar_Map.md) and Continental Maps.
