There are ten battle continents in Planetside: six [Home
Continents](/Home_Continent "wikilink") and four [Neutral
Continents](/Neutral_Continent "wikilink"). Capturing these continents
are the main object of the war. [Pre-Bending](/The_Bending "wikilink")
these continents were located on a single planet called Auraxis, but
ever since the event the continents have been pushed out to exist on ten
seperate [planets](/planet "wikilink").

Capturing, or [locking](/Continental_lock "wikilink"), a type of
continent can provide certain benefits for each Empire depending on its
[Home](/Home_Continent "wikilink") or
[Neutral](/Neutral_Continent "wikilink") status.

A continent can be reached by traveling through the
[warpgates](/warpgate "wikilink") or [broadcast
warpgates](/broadcast_warpgate "wikilink"), and via the [HART
Shuttle](/HART "wikilink") system located in each Empire's
[Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink"). It can also be reached by selecting
[Instant Action](/Instant_Action "wikilink") from your Esc
[Menu](/Menu "wikilink").

Each Continent can be viewed from the
[Interstellar](/Interstellar_Map "wikilink") and Continental Maps.
