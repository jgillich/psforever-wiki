The **Range Magnifier** Implant provides a weapon-independent zoom
capability of x4, x8 and x12 magnification. The zoom function becomes
independent of any unholstered weapon, allowing a soldier to stay zoomed
when normally the function would be turned off, such as during
reloading, driving a [vehicle](vehicle "wikilink"), and gunning.

The x12 zoom option is more powerful than the standard zoom attached to
most weapons, including the [Bolt Driver](Bolt_Driver "wikilink"), which
stops at x8. The exception is the [Scorpion](Scorpion "wikilink"), which
has a x12 magnification by default.

Primarily used by Snipers, in conjunction with the [Bolt
Driver](Bolt_Driver "wikilink"), this implant can offer increased
accuracy. However, the usefulness of x12 magnification is debatable,
given the dynamic way in which maximum render distance is determined by
the game, and the added difficulty that micromanaging the independent
zoom can entail.
