[weapons](Weapons_Index "wikilink"), ammunition,
[armor](Armor_Index "wikilink"), support equipment, and vehicle
ordnance. [Ancient-Tech](Ancient-Tech "wikilink") weaponry can also be
acquired if an [Equipment Module](Equipment_Module "wikilink") is
installed or a [Cavern Lock](Cavern_Lock "wikilink") is linked through
the [lattice](lattice "wikilink").

These terminals are crucial to any war effort and can be found in
numerous places. Each [Advanced Mobile
Station](Advanced_Mobile_Station "wikilink"), or AMS, supplies two on
either side of the vehicle. The [Respawn
Building](Respawn_Building "wikilink"), [VR
Training](VR_Training "wikilink") Rooms, [HART
building](HART_building "wikilink"), and [towers](towers "wikilink") in
each Empire's [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") contain two or more
equipment terminals.

All base [facilities](facilities "wikilink") provide equipment terminals
in the [Respawn rooms](Respawn_room "wikilink") and the [main
lobby](main_lobby "wikilink"). [Interlink
Facilities](Interlink_Facility "wikilink") and [Dropship
Centers](Dropship_Center "wikilink") contain extra teriminals on the top
level in the alcove beneath the radar dish.

Every [tower](towers "wikilink") also contains equipment terminals in
their Respawn rooms.

and supply yourself for various situations after respawning.

Equipment terminals can be destroyed, and must be repaired to 50% of
their health before they can be used again with a [Nano
Dispenser](Nano_Dispenser "wikilink").

The Cavern [Facilities](Facilities "wikilink") possess
[Ancient-Tech](Ancient-Tech "wikilink") versions called [Ancient
Equipment Terminals](Ancient_Equipment_Terminal "wikilink"). They
provide the same equipment as their surface counterparts, including
Ancient Tech weaponry. Ancient Equipment Terminals cannot be destroyed
unlike the surface Equipment Terminals. See [Core
Combat](Core_Combat "wikilink").
