Installing this [module](modules.md) provides the
[benefit](module_benefit.md) of having [Pain
Fields](Pain_Field.md) in the [Respawn
room](Respawn_room.md) and [Generator](Generator.md)
room that deal 5 damage per second to any enemy inside it. While there
is always a [Pain Field](Pain_Field.md) in the [Respawn
room](Respawn_room.md) when the
[generator](generator.md) is online, the pain module increases
its lethality. [Cavern](Cavern.md) spawn rooms deal Pain Module
damage by default.

The pain module is useful for base defense and to protect other modules
installed at the base. When combined with the boosted pain fields from
[expert hackers](Expert_Hacking.md) (increasing the damage done
to 15 damage per second), it is very difficult to destroy the generator,
and thus difficult for the enemy to steal modules. Similarly, when
combined with a boosted pain field, the [Spawn
Tubes](Spawn_Tube.md) are difficult to destroy as well, normally
forcing the enemy to place a hack on the base before the tubes can be
destroyed.

This module appears as beige on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md).
