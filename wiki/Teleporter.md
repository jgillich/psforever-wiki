There are three types of Teleporter in Planetside.

- Sanctuary Virtual Transit Link

Each [Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md) Island is divided into three
[HART](HART.md) complexes. These columns, located at each corner
of the [HART building](HART_building.md), allow instant travel
between each complex. These are one-way, but operate cyclically, so just
keep stepping into the column until you are at the complex you want.

These same teleporters are used in the [VR
Training](VR_Training.md) areas and allow access to the vehicle
range, shooting range, and exit from virtual reality.

- Ancient Technology Cave Teleporter Rings

The [Core Combat](Core_Combat.md) [Caverns](Caverns.md)
are dotted with glowing ring-pairs at strategic places on the floor.
These are one-way travel from a cyan ring, to it's matching purple ring,
and are typically used instead of stairs in Core buildings, and are only
found in the caves, not above ground. Note: if you are still on top of
the destination telepad when an enemy unit transports on top of you, you
will be killed, and [BEP](BEP.md) awarded to the enemy. This is
a tactic sometimes used by enemy cloakers to kill you instantly (without
firing).

- Router Telepad

A deployed [Router](Router.md) and correctly placed
[Telepad](Telepad.md) form an instantaneous link between them,
accessed by stepping into either the beam beneath the
[Router](Router.md) itself, or the floating telepad dome at the
other end. This link allows for two-way travel.
