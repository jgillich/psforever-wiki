**Burster (BFR)**

The Burster air defense system operates similarly to the
[Burster](Burster.md) equipped AA [MAX](MAX.md), rapidly
firing [Flak](Flak.md) shells that explode in proximity to enemy
air. However, it is significantly less deadly than its
[MAX](MAX.md) counterpart. Its fast and straight-line
projectiles means that it is also somewhat effective against infantry
and light armor.
