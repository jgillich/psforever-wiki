Similar to a normal [Equipment terminal](Equipment_terminal.md),
but looking vastly different, [Ancient Equipment
Terminals](Ancient_Equipment_Terminal.md) are large, oddly
shaped objects within the [Caverns](Core_Combat.md) which allows
you to acquire your normal equipment, and any [Ancient
Technology](Ancient_Technology.md) Weapon.

The terminals can be found throughout the caves in various buildings.
Unless they are located in an enemy [Redoubt
Building](Redoubt_Building.md), [AT Plant](AT_Plant.md),
or [Module Building](Module_Building.md), the Ancient Equipment
Terminals are neutral, and thus everyone can use it without
[hacking](hack.md) it.

Note: Some Ancient Equipment Terminals are misplaced inside walls. These
can still be used if you point your cursor at the top of the structure.
