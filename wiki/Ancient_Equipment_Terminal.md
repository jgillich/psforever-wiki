Similar to a normal [Equipment terminal](/Equipment_terminal "wikilink"),
but looking vastly different, [Ancient Equipment
Terminals](/Ancient_Equipment_Terminal "wikilink") are large, oddly
shaped objects within the [Caverns](/Core_Combat "wikilink") which allows
you to acquire your normal equipment, and any [Ancient
Technology](/Ancient_Technology "wikilink") Weapon.

The terminals can be found throughout the caves in various buildings.
Unless they are located in an enemy [Redoubt
Building](/Redoubt_Building "wikilink"), [AT Plant](/AT_Plant "wikilink"),
or [Module Building](/Module_Building "wikilink"), the Ancient Equipment
Terminals are neutral, and thus everyone can use it without
[hacking](/hack "wikilink") it.

Note: Some Ancient Equipment Terminals are misplaced inside walls. These
can still be used if you point your cursor at the top of the structure.
