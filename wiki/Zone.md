A **Zone** is a general term referring to an individual area of the
persistent world's geography.

In terms of [Server](Server.md) topography, a zone is supported
by a server or a server cluster working in unison, allowing characters
to interact with each other within the zone.

Entering and leaving a zone will also instruct the
[Client](Client.md) to load and unload the graphical resources
needed to display that area.

Zones in [PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md) are referred to as
[Planets](Planet.md), [Continents](Continent.md), and
[Caverns](Caverns.md).
