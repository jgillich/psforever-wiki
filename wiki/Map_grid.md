The Map Grid is a co-ordinate based overlay on the [Continental
Map](/Continental_Map "wikilink").

Letters indicate position horizontally, and numbers for vertical. This
grid divides continents up into areas roughly the size of a
[Facility](/Facility "wikilink"), and allows co-ordaintion via chat, if
Squad [Waypoints](/Waypoint "wikilink") are unavailable, or unecessary.

A squad member's current grid reference is displayed in the
[Squad](/Squad "wikilink") Bar, at the top of the screen.
