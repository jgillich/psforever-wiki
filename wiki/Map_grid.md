The Map Grid is a co-ordinate based overlay on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink").

Letters indicate position horizontally, and numbers for vertical. This
grid divides continents up into areas roughly the size of a
[Facility](Facility.md "wikilink"), and allows co-ordaintion via chat, if
Squad [Waypoints](Waypoint.md "wikilink") are unavailable, or unecessary.

A squad member's current grid reference is displayed in the
[Squad](Squad.md "wikilink") Bar, at the top of the screen.
