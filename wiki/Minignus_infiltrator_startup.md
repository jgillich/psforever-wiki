Right this is for the REALLY new people ;)

First up remember that if you want LOADS of kills this not be the setup
for you. If you are new it's probably best to start with heavy assault
and the like.

## CERTS

There are many certs that are useful with infiltrator:

- **Combat engineering:** Probably the best cert you can have as an
  infiltrator. Boomers can be used to take out unwary snipers, turrets
  and unwary troops with ease. By deploying a boomer at the back door
  of a facility you can get the odd kill very easily. Boomers are also
  useful for taking down generators, spawn tubes or terminals meaning
  a single infiltrator can really slow down enemy proggress. Spitfires
  are handy in the field or on defence. They are likely to draw enemy
  fire from you but it may mean the enemy can realise you are nearby
  so strategic placing is encouraged. Mines are great for infiltrators
  as they are seriously dangerous against vehicles and MAXes. Even if
  the enemy sees you you may be able to get a kill depending on your
  reactions. If a MAX sees you simply jump behind him and lay a mine
  to take off about 1/2 health and armour.

Boomer damage table hijacked from [iluvthequasar's
thread](http://psforums.station.sony.com/ps/board/message?board.id=psstrategy&message.id=9192):

`*1 boomer: ANY terminal, ATV, infantry, Spitfire turret`

`*2 boomers: Lightning, MAX, any Buggy, Reaver, Mosquito, Unmanned FV, Spawn tube `

`*3 boomers: Deliverer and Variants, ANT, Liberator`

`*4 boomers: Wall turret, MBT, Sunderer, AMS, Unmanned GV, Galaxy, Lodestar`

`*6 boomers: The Generator `

- **Advanced hacking:** An easy if boring way to help your empire is
  take towers behind enemy lines. If you take a tower you are
  distracting troops of the opposing empire or providing a helpful
  spawn point for your own troops. You can be handy to your empire by
  being the first into a CC and taking it quickly. Also consider
  certing uni-MAX and taking one out in an enemy base for some nasty
  suprises... Also it helps to have a way to replenish your supplies
  in the field and using adv hacking you can easily get a few aces or
  anything else you need. Of course you can also steal an enemy tank
  and if you find one an AMS.

<!-- -->

- **Air cav:** Some people see this as a MUST HAVE for cloakers. I can
  see their point as it gives an infiltrator a quick and safeish mode
  of transportation. The reaver is an undeniably handy and versatile
  vehicle useful for recannaisance, tank busting, infantry killing,
  hotdropping, dogfighting....the list goes on. The mossie is a better
  choice for the infiltrator though because of it's speed, immunity to
  radar and inbuilt radar makng it the better choice to hotdrop and
  perhaps infiltrate enemy facilities.

<!-- -->

- **Ground support:** Both the router and AMS have their uses to the
  cloaker. Firstly we have the AMS. Because of it's cloaking bubble
  and equipment terminals it's the obvious choice for a rallying
  point. Also the fact that you can spawn at it is an obvious plus.
  However the players that spawn from it are likely to attract
  attention and the odd OS making it risky. The router's telepad can
  be a hell of a use for the cloaker as it allows you and you're mates
  easy access to the enemies base helping you in any objectives you
  may have.

<!-- -->

- **ATV:** Now we come to the wraith. It is fast and maneuverable and
  more importantly invisable which is of course handy for getting from
  A to B. However it really comes into it's own as a supply depot.
  It's massive inventory means you can stuff it full of medpacks,
  ACEs, pistols....anything really. Deploy it near an objective (a
  bridge that needs mining, a gen that needs dropping, snipers that
  need killing) and you will see how useful it really is. Why not use
  an AMS? Well the wraith is less noticable. It is unlikely to be seen
  by the enemy if you hide it well and even if it is noticed, most
  people will ignore it anyway. And it is only one cert point with the
  switchblade, basilisk and fury thrown in too! Bargainous.

<!-- -->

- **Uni-MAX:** As said above can be very fun if combined with advanced
  hack. Imagine spawning at a safe base and walking into a deployed
  dual-cycler max.... ouchie. Also it's nice to make a change now and
  then.

## IMPLANTS

- **Darklight:** Useful to keep an eye out for the competition. Makes
  you look kinda stupid if you get stabbed by an enemy cloaker while
  going for that sniper kill. Although i tend to not kill other
  cloakes unless they attack me (honour and all that) some people will
  just go for them and turn into a cloaker hunter. It's really up to
  your playing style.

<!-- -->

- **Sensor shield:** I can't stress this enough this is ESSENTIAL FOR
  ALL CLOAKERS. It stops spits form killing you without you getting a
  small chance, stops mossies nailing you, nerfs the enemies radar and
  stops gen pain fields... all these things are useful for the cloaker
  in their day to day lives (and deaths...).

<!-- -->

- **Surge:** can be handy if you don't have access to transport or if
  you are in a tricky situation and need to escape. I tell you a
  surging infiltrator is difficult to see let alone HIT. I remember
  when i had it and kept surging out of a surrounded spawn room and
  dropping boomers behing enemy squads camping the corridors. 5 kills
  in one go...ouch.

<!-- -->

- **Enhanced targetting:** You never really notice this one unless it
  isn't there.... Being able to see health of everything is one of the
  best abilities in the game. You can see that the lightning over
  there will explode with one more mine or that sniper will keel over
  if you whack him with your knife just once.... Being able to see if
  someone has DL activated is great to and can be a real life saver.

<!-- -->

- **Melee booster:** This really depends on your play style. Killing
  someone in only two knife hits is satisfying but this cert is only
  worth it if you are knifing people constantly. Most people will pass
  this over in favour of just using a normal melee attack, a pistol,
  grenade or ACE.

<!-- -->

- **Personal shield:** I'm sure there are some cloakers who use this
  but there is no real point. If you get attacked your only real
  defence is to kill the enemy or run away before they draw their
  weapon. It's best left to the surgile or rexo players of the world.

<!-- -->

- **Audio amplifier:** A nice implant for scouts as you can see (or in
  this case hear) the enemy coming from a while off. This can get you
  out of many tricky situations but again it depends on your
  playstyle. If you are spending long times outside hunting AMS',
  vehicles and snipers you may not have much of a need for this
  implant.

<!-- -->

- **Second wind:** Lets face it this isn't the best implant in the
  world. In fact it's pants. Giving you the slightest of boosts (25
  health + 25 stamina) in situations that will probably leave you dead
  anyway. Even the players who play as grunts and expect to take heavy
  damage don't take this.

<!-- -->

- **Regeneration:** Perhaps you may be able to find use for this but
  that stamina could be used elsewhere (say on DL or SS) and in my
  personal opinion (and here comes all the pro cloakers laughing at
  me) if you are shot at you are compromised and probably dead
  already. If you find you can escape these situations you may find
  this handy.

## YOUR TOOLS

- **Knife:** The ever handy and versatile knife. If put on secondary
  can kill agiles and rexos in about 3 swings and if teamed up with
  melee booster (see above) kills in two. Useful on pheonix users as
  they are unaware of their surroundings when firing and also useful
  on snipers.

<!-- -->

- **Plasma grenades:** Being standard assault all can benefit from
  these. 3 direct hits if timed correctly takes down an agile/rexo and
  one direct hit on an infil will kill it dead (needless to say DON'T
  drop them.) with 30 of them able to fit in your inventory this means
  you can kill a fair few before having to resupply. HOWEVER the first
  thing someone will do if plasma grenaded in the middle of nowhere is
  turn on dark light. The best way to counter this is to sit on towers
  and walls as for some reson noone will check there. Go figure...

<!-- -->

- **Frag grenades:** As they make an explosion similar to many, many,
  many things in ps and make a comparable noise these are stealthier
  than plasma and do more damage to MAXes and vehicles. However they
  do less damage to infantry as a tradeoff and it is unlikely that you
  will be able to kill a MAX or vehicle with it. Probably best to
  stick with plasma grenades in most (but not all)cases.

<!-- -->

- **Jammer grenades:** Ahhh the ever useful jammer. It can be used for
  many things as a cloaker. Stopping someone being able to detect you
  with DL or AA is the most used one. Also you can use 'em to clear
  mines or silence spitfires. Stopping tanks firing at you or your
  mates is great as well. My favourite use for them though is as
  traps. By sticking down a solid mass of boomers in say, a tech plant
  vehicle driveway you can blow up pretty much ANYTHING. You can
  detonate enemy mines to clear CE and blow up enemy tanks in a
  semi-ironic way or use them to set up explosves around a generator
  and take it down in one smooth blow.

<!-- -->

- **AMP:** The automatic machine pistol is useful but not my preferred
  choice. It can spew out bullets fast and is excellent for close up
  combat. It however does suffer from massive COF and isn't exactly
  subtle or covert... I think it does have the shortest TTK though
  (testing it out soon) so if you get the jump on the enemy you can
  probably take them down.

<http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/TR-Repeater_small.jpg>

- **Repeater:** Powerful, accurate and long range (for a pistol) this
  is the closest thing a TR infiltrator gets to a sniper rifle. It can
  be used to hit enemies from out of DL range and if you are carful
  you can avoid detection.

<http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/NC-MAG-Scatter_small.jpg>

- **Mag-scatterpistol:** The shotgun-like pistol of the NC is only
  useful upclose for obvious reasons. It's heavy power means you can
  easily kill off wounded enemies (which is a _little_ unsporting) or
  cloakers. It's short range means you have to exercise caution but if
  used correctly this is a good weapon.

<http://www.phantomphoenix.com/Planetside/VS-Beamer_small.jpg>

- **Beamer:** The VS laser-gun-type-thing (technical term) is powerful
  and fast firing. It is similar to both the AMP and repeater and is
  cited by a few as the best standard assault pistol available. It's
  projectiles are easily spotted though meaning you can be asily seen
  and VS ammo can be hard to find in the field if you run out. These
  are minor gripes though.

<!-- -->

- **Spiker:** The ultimate pistol, this is only available if you own
  core combat. It has potential to have MASSIVE stopping power and
  it's maelstrom/lasher style lashes make it excellent against tight
  formations or in indoor combat. It chews up ammo quickly though and
  has the unfortunate ability of making you light up like
  an...um...light. Still very worth it though.

<!-- -->

- **Laze targetter:** Not as useful as it was thanks to the lack of
  flails these days, this tool used to be very handy. It is still
  useful for marking targets for OSes, EMPes or bombing strikes. Can
  be used to point your squad towards an AMS if you find one too.

<!-- -->

- **CUD:** Obvious uses really so i don't need to say much. EMP is one
  of the first things to do when you drop from a gal.

<!-- -->

- **Med app:** Some people carry these in order to keep themselves
  alive during an infiltration but they take up 1/5 of your inventory
  losing you space that could be used for an ACE or other useful item.
  Personally I use Medi-kit drops. I simply stick a couple of med kits
  in my locker or in the trunk of a vehicle and use them when i need
  them. I could also hack a term or steal them from other people but
  this is less likely to attract attention while infiltrating.

## TACTICS AND GAMEPLAY

- **Keep an eye on what you are doing:** If you are playing as an
  _infiltrator_ and not a _cloaker_ try to keep an objective in mind.
  The difference being between these two roles is that a cloaker will
  try to infiltrate an enemy base in order to help his or her empire
  whereas the cloaker is playing for kills (yes I know these are large
  generalisations). When infiltrating keep in mind your objectives at
  all times. For example you may be sneaking into an enemy base to
  destroy and hold down vehicle terminals or going for a generator
  drop then remember to head in those directions and try not to get
  side tracked (this doesn't mean you shouldn't go for targets of
  oppertunity....Just try to get done what you set out to do). If you
  are playing as a cloaker then try to keep aware of both your target
  and the people around him. Many a time have i seen a cloaker being
  gunned down by someone watching their teammates back.

<!-- -->

- **Remember to hide:** You are **NOT** invisible unless you are
  completely still not using anything. Although it is pathetic some
  people use a gamma hack to see cloakers a lot easier than usual,
  however you can easily counter this out in the field. If you see
  someone who has noticed you pretend you don't know and move to get
  behind a large hill or rock and lay down a spitfire or two and if
  you have time a couple of mines. As soon as he gets there he will be
  shot, exploded and then he is easy pray to a quick knife attack.
  Grrrr. Also remember to use cover when possible. It makes you harder
  to see and hit.
