![](AT-CC.md.jpg "fig:AT-CC.jpg") Control Console\]\]

The Ancient Control Console is the [Control
Console](Control_Console.md "wikilink") of a [Cavern](Cavern.md "wikilink")
[Facility](Facility.md "wikilink").

They work the same way as the [Surface Facility Control
Consoles](Control_Console.md "wikilink") do; however, the Ancient Control
Consoles only have a 10 minute timer on the hack, as opposed to the 15
minute timer for the Surface Facilities.

These consoles do not spawn [LLUs](LLU.md "wikilink").
