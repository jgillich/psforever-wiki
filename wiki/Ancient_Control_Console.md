The Ancient Control Console is the [Control
Console](/Control_Console "wikilink") of a [Cavern](/Cavern "wikilink")
[Facility](/Facility "wikilink").

They work the same way as the [Surface Facility Control
Consoles](/Control_Console "wikilink") do; however, the Ancient Control
Consoles only have a 10 minute timer on the hack, as opposed to the 15
minute timer for the Surface Facilities.

These consoles do not spawn [LLUs](/LLU "wikilink").
