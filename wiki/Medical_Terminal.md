Medical Terminals can be found in all
[Facilities](/Facilities "wikilink") (except [Towers](/Tower "wikilink"))
and in the [HART building](/HART_building "wikilink") in
[Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink"). There are usually 2 Medical Terminals
in each base. One is located behind the [spawn
room](/spawn_room "wikilink") in the [barracks](/barracks "wikilink") (or
[Research Room](/Research_Room "wikilink") in a [Bio
Laboratory](/Bio_Laboratory "wikilink")) and another one in or near the
[Main lobby](/Main_lobby "wikilink") (Bio Labs feature an [Advanced
Medical Terminal](/Advanced_Medical_Terminal "wikilink") near the lobby
instead of a regular one).

While standing in a Medical Terminal a soldier's Health and Armor will
be healed at approximately ten (10) points per second, up to the
soldier's maximum.
