Medical Terminals can be found in all
[Facilities](Facilities.md "wikilink") (except [Towers](Tower.md "wikilink"))
and in the [HART building](HART_building.md "wikilink") in
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink"). There are usually 2 Medical Terminals
in each base. One is located behind the [spawn
room](spawn_room.md "wikilink") in the [barracks](barracks.md "wikilink") (or
[Research Room](Research_Room.md "wikilink") in a [Bio
Laboratory](Bio_Laboratory.md "wikilink")) and another one in or near the
[Main lobby](Main_lobby.md "wikilink") (Bio Labs feature an [Advanced
Medical Terminal](Advanced_Medical_Terminal.md "wikilink") near the lobby
instead of a regular one).

While standing in a Medical Terminal a soldier's Health and Armor will
be healed at approximately ten (10) points per second, up to the
soldier's maximum.
