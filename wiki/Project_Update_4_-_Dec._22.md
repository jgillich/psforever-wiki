Just a brief update for the project.

The capture submission has been a great success with 8,801,315 records
across 307 capture files submitted so far! If you submitted, thank you
so much for your time. If PlanetSide's servers went down today, we'd be
in good shape.

In other good news, I have just open sourced the GameLauncher and
GameLogger tools to GitHub. This means that the GCAP capture files that
have been submitted can now be parsed by anyone who wishes it. Also
anyone who is enterprising enough can contribute their own changes to
the tools (please do). Check out the open source projects now! If you
are a C# programmer or someone who wants to learn, have a read through
the code. It's not the cleanest, but it should be mostly understandable.

From here, the full focus of this project will be getting a minimal
login and game server up and running. This is going to be slow at first
as there is a lot of boilerplate to be written, such as a PlanetSide
compatible networking library. I hope to have some screenshots and
things to test within the next couple of months, my schedule permitting.
At the moment, I'm not sure if the servers will be open source from the
start, or I will open source them when I feel it is appropriate.

It's been a good couple of months for the project. We started from
nothing and now we're here. The best parts are yet to come. Stick around
and enjoy your holidays!
