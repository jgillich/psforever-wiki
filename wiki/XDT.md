## The Xtreme Damage Team

![](Oi_decal09.md.gif "Oi_decal09.gif")

The Xtreme Damage Team (!!X\]\[D\]\[T!!) was an old outfit on the
[Werner](Werner.md) server, originally created by
[TheBackDoorBanditCrew](bandit.md) on January 4th, 2004. The
outfit steadily grew over the years, but was never considered big. The
Xtreme Damage Team was often considered by its members to specialize in
[spec ops](Acronyms_and_Slang.md#S), including gendrops and
stealth drain & hacks. [TeamSpeak](TeamSpeak.md) was an integral
part of the outfit and its operations.

During October of 2005, TheBackDoorBanditCrew stepped down and
[Skull-Hunter](SkullHunter.md) was appointed as the outfit
leader.

### Alliances

In summer of 2005 !!X\]\[D\]\[T!! applied membership for the [New
Conglomerate Werner Alliance](NCWA.md) (NCWA) and was
subsequently accepted, joining the ranks of outfits like [Fight
Club](Fight_Club.md) and [58th Marine
Corp](</58th_Marine_Corp_(The_Wildcards)>). Strong inter-outfit
relations was established or strenghtened and players enjoyed great
levels of teamwork and co-operation.

Though never officially announced, NCWA has since ceased to exist, and
!!X\]\[D\]\[T!! can no longer be considered to be part of the alliance.

### Current status and future

The outfit is inactive in the original PlanetSide. As for PlanetSide 2,
there are concrete plans for a revival.
