## The Xtreme Damage Team

![](Oi_decal09.gif "Oi_decal09.gif")

The Xtreme Damage Team (!!X\]\[D\]\[T!!) was an old outfit on the
[Werner](Werner "wikilink") server, originally created by
[TheBackDoorBanditCrew](bandit "wikilink") on January 4th, 2004. The
outfit steadily grew over the years, but was never considered big. The
Xtreme Damage Team was often considered by its members to specialize in
[spec ops](Acronyms_and_Slang#S "wikilink"), including gendrops and
stealth drain & hacks. [TeamSpeak](TeamSpeak "wikilink") was an integral
part of the outfit and its operations.

During October of 2005, TheBackDoorBanditCrew stepped down and
[Skull-Hunter](SkullHunter "wikilink") was appointed as the outfit
leader.

### Alliances

In summer of 2005 !!X\]\[D\]\[T!! applied membership for the [New
Conglomerate Werner Alliance](NCWA "wikilink") (NCWA) and was
subsequently accepted, joining the ranks of outfits like [Fight
Club](Fight_Club "wikilink") and [58th Marine
Corp](58th_Marine_Corp_(The_Wildcards) "wikilink"). Strong inter-outfit
relations was established or strenghtened and players enjoyed great
levels of teamwork and co-operation.

Though never officially announced, NCWA has since ceased to exist, and
!!X\]\[D\]\[T!! can no longer be considered to be part of the alliance.

### Current status and future

The outfit is inactive in the original PlanetSide. As for PlanetSide 2,
there are concrete plans for a revival.
