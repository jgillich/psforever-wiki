Any [characters](character "wikilink") trying to enter a
[zone](zone "wikilink") currently under [population
lock](population_lock "wikilink") via a [warpgate](warpgate "wikilink"),
[geowarp](geowarp "wikilink"), or the [HART](HART "wikilink") shuttle,
rather than immediately being transported to the target continent will
be placed in the **Warp Queue**.

The character's position in the queue is displayed in a small box on the
[HUD](HUD "wikilink") and overlaid on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map "wikilink"). A 'cancel' button is also provided to
allow players a chance to travel to a different zone. If the player
chooses to cancel from the queue, he will lose his place in line. If the
driver leaves a [vehicle](vehicle "wikilink") while in the queue, he
will also lose his place. Any character entering a vehicle where the
driver is already in the queue will share the driver's space in the
queue. This latter also creates the need for enough slots to fill up to
handle all occupants of the vehicle.

While waiting in the queue, characters may still use the
[/broadcast](In-Game_Commands "wikilink") chat channel for the continent
they are leaving. In the case where a warpgate or geowarp is being used,
the player can close the map and move around their current zone as
normal. Moving to another zone or being killed will also result in the
player being removed from the queue.
