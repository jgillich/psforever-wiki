The **initialization timer** refers to the amount of time each
[Implant](/Implant "wikilink") takes to become available for use from the
time it is "reset." Implants are reset by [spawning](/spawn "wikilink")
(after death) or by being hit with a [Jammer
grenade](/Jammer_grenade "wikilink") or [EMP](/EMP "wikilink") blast.

Each Implant has its own timer, which ranges from 1 minute to 3 minutes
and 10 seconds, depending on the implant.
