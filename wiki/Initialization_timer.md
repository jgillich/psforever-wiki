The **initialization timer** refers to the amount of time each
[Implant](Implant.md) takes to become available for use from the
time it is "reset." Implants are reset by [spawning](spawn.md)
(after death) or by being hit with a [Jammer
grenade](Jammer_grenade.md) or [EMP](EMP.md) blast.

Each Implant has its own timer, which ranges from 1 minute to 3 minutes
and 10 seconds, depending on the implant.
