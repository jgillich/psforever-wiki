## What is a Stub and Why Don't We Like Them

A stub is an article of a few sentences that only conveys a simple
definition and description of a subject. These articles are devoid of
the majority of information about them. In the effort to continuously
expand the wiki, articles should contain as much pertinent information
about them as possible.

Stubs are lacking in several areas and crave to be expanded. When a stub
is expanded, it should be ensured that reliable sources are cited where
needed. Once a stub is expanded so that it can be considered a
full-length article, the {{stub}} tag should be removed.
