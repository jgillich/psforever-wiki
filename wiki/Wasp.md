**Wasp**

The Wasp Interceptor requires the [Technology
Plant](Technology_Plant.md "wikilink") benefit to be purchasable.

The Wasp has significantly less armor than the
[Mosquito](Mosquito.md "wikilink") (we're talking paper-thin here), but
carries two AA missile launchers. These missile launchers can only fire
when they have a lock, and do not fire very quickly. The Wasp carries
enough for 10 volleys (2 loaded and 18 spare ammo) in the default
loadout.

It should be noted that the 12mm chaingun is nowhere near as efficient
as the one that is on the [Mosquito](Mosquito.md "wikilink"). It fires at a
similar ROF to the [Vulture](Vulture.md "wikilink")'s nosegun, but carries
only 30 shots at a time and a further 10 reloads. It's meant for
finishing punches, not mowing down infantry.

The Wasp's [afterburner](afterburner.md "wikilink") lasts twice as long,
but speed seems identical to that of the
[Mosquito](Mosquito.md "wikilink"). The Wasp also lacks the
[Mosquito](Mosquito.md "wikilink")'s Overflight Radar system.
