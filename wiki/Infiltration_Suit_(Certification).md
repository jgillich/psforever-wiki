**Infiltration Suit**

While this is not technically armor, the "stealth suit" allows you to
cloak yourself on the battlefield to avoid visual detection. The slower
you move, the less visible you are. When driving a
[Wraith](Wraith.md) you may cloak both yourself and the vehicle.
[Darklight](Darklight.md) Vision and [Audio
Amplifier](Audio_Amplifier.md) [Implants](Implants.md)
will aid other players in detecting you. The Infiltration Suit provides
no armor protection, doesn't allow the use of a rifle, and has a very
small inventory.
