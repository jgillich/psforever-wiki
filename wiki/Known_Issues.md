Known Issues

</title>

``<text xml:space="preserve">`There are only so many hours in the day for the`[`SOE`](Sony_Online_Entertainment.md)`crew to fix bugs. To report a bug, please visit the official forums or use the /bug command in game. Below is a list of currently known bugs and ways to work around them.`

- BFR Bug
  - Description: When gunning for a [BFR](BattleFrame_Robotics.md) you can
    only aim up and down, when the BFR walks you stay in one place
    and not with the driver.
  - Workaround: Immediately bail out of the BFR and then go back in.

- Door Bug
  - Description: Facility doors sometimes appear closed even though
    they are in fact open and enemy fire can go through. This bug
    most commonly occurs at the [Back Door](Back_Door.md).
  - Workaround: Go up to the door and open it manually. This is only
    a temporary fix and the bug can occur again at any time.

- Friendly-Manned Ancient Sentry Turret Bug
  - Description: Sometimes a member of your own empire that is
    manning an [Ancient Sentry
    Turret](Ancient_Sentry_Turret.md) will have their name
    in enemy colors as seen with the [Enhanced
    Targeting](Enhanced_Targeting.md)
    [implant](Implants.md). You get [grief](Grief_points.md)
    for shooting the seemingly enemy-held turret even if the
    friendly is in your own [platoon](Platoon.md).
  - Workaround: None. You can ask the occupant to get out and back
    in which will likely fix the problem. If you find friendlies
    shooting at you constantly, get out and back in yourself!

<!-- -->

- Scorpion Bug
  - Description: Sometimes the secondary bomblets fired from the
    [Scorpion](Scorpion.md) do not emerge from the primary
    explosion, basically making the weapon useless.
  - Workaround: Sometimes dropping the weapon on the ground then
    picking it up works. Other times you have to respawn to fix the
    problem.

<!-- -->

- Missile Lock-on Bug
  - Description: Sometimes lock-on weapons
    ([Striker](Striker.md), [Starfire](Starfire.md),
    [Sparrow](Sparrow.md), and [Wasp](Wasp.md)) only
    lock or maintain lock when the crosshair is directly over the
    target, making it almost impossible to maintain a lock on your
    target.
  - Workaround: Usually the only way to fix the problem is to quit
    and open PlanetSide again. Respawning does not fix the problem
    in most cases.

<!-- -->

- [Enhanced Targeting](Enhanced_Targeting.md) Bug
  - Description: The Enhanced Targeting
    [implant](Implants.md) will sometimes show an enemy
    [vehicle](Vehicle.md) or [Wall
    Turret](Phalanx_Turret.md) as having almost no health
    left, while in fact they are at full health. This sometimes
    happens when the vehicle is damaged, goes out of draw distance
    to repair, and then draws again at a later time. You will see
    the health it had the last time you saw the vehicle, and do not
    see that it was repaired.
  - Workaround: Dealing any damage to the enemy vehicle or Turret
    will cause its proper health to display.
