    infantry and more for transport.

    time.
  - 35mm bullet speed and damage have been increased.
  - [Ground Pounder](Ground_Pounder.md) damage has been
    increased.

- [Combat Engineers](Combat_Engineering.md)
  - There has been a recent breakthrough in engineering technology
    for players who are trained in [Advanced
    Engineering](Advanced_Engineering.md) concepts! Combat
    Engineers now use [Armor Canisters](Armor_Canister.md)
    more efficiently and will be able to repair
    [MAX](MAX.md) units, equipment, and
    [vehicles](vehicles.md) faster than players with the
    standard Engineering [certification](certification.md).
    Repair speed is further increased for players with
    [Fortification](Fortification_Engineering.md),
    [Assault](Assault_Engineering.md), or Advanced
    Engineering. Infantry armor other than MAX armor will not be
    affected by this change.
