Version 3.12.31 (Thursday August 23, 2007)

- [Phantasm](Phantasm.md "wikilink")
  - Removed the gun so the Phantasm will be used less for farming
    infantry and more for transport.
  - Reduced explosion damage on destruction.

<!-- -->

- [Galaxy Gunship](Galaxy_Gunship.md "wikilink")
  - Greatly increased armor while only slightly increasing repair
    time.
  - 35mm bullet speed and damage have been increased.
  - [Ground Pounder](Ground_Pounder.md "wikilink") damage has been
    increased.
  - Angle of fire has been increased for front and wing guns.

<!-- -->

- [Combat Engineers](Combat_Engineering.md "wikilink")
  - There has been a recent breakthrough in engineering technology
    for players who are trained in [Advanced
    Engineering](Advanced_Engineering.md "wikilink") concepts! Combat
    Engineers now use [Armor Canisters](Armor_Canister.md "wikilink")
    more efficiently and will be able to repair
    [MAX](MAX.md "wikilink") units, equipment, and
    [vehicles](vehicles.md "wikilink") faster than players with the
    standard Engineering [certification](certification.md "wikilink").
    Repair speed is further increased for players with
    [Fortification](Fortification_Engineering.md "wikilink"),
    [Assault](Assault_Engineering.md "wikilink"), or Advanced
    Engineering. Infantry armor other than MAX armor will not be
    affected by this change.
