**Health**, is a measure of a soldier's physical condition. Health is
shown as a red guage in the [Bio
pane](Heads-up_Display#Bio_Pane "wikilink"). If you have no armor, all
damage taken will come from your health, but with armor only a fraction
of the damage will come from your health. [Pain
Fields](Pain_Field "wikilink"), the [Radiator](Radiator "wikilink"), and
the [Damage Crystal](Damage_Crystal "wikilink") bypass your armor and
affect your health directly.

Health can be recovered by using a [MedKit](MedKit "wikilink"), [Super
Medkit](Super_Medkit "wikilink"), [Medical
Applicator](Medical_Applicator "wikilink"),
[Regeneration](Regeneration "wikilink") or [Second
Wind](Second_Wind "wikilink") [Implants](Implants "wikilink") or
standing near a [Health Crystal](Health_Crystal "wikilink") or in a
[Medical Terminal](Medical_Terminal "wikilink").

The [Health Module](Health_Module "wikilink") can also recover your
health. When you are within the [SOI](SOI "wikilink") of a base with
this benefit, you health will slowly regenerate. The [Health
Module](Health_Module "wikilink") also raises your maximum health to
120/120.

The Health of friendly soldiers can be seen above their heads as a green
bar, if close enough, with black sections indicating damage. The Health
of enemy soldiers can be seen with the [Enhanced
Targeting](Enhanced_Targeting "wikilink") Implant, as a red bar.
