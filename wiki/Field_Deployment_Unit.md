**Field Deployment Unit (FDU)**

The FDU is required to deploy the
[TRAP](Tactical_Resonance_Area_Protection.md "wikilink") for the
[Fortification Engineers](Fortification_Engineering.md "wikilink"), and
[Aegis Shield Generator](Aegis_Shield_Generator.md "wikilink") and
[One-Manned Field Turrets](One.$1.md "wikilink") for the
[Assault Engineers](Assault_Engineering.md "wikilink").

It is as big as the largest Rifle in your
[inventory](inventory.md "wikilink"), and is consumed when used to deploy
something.

Like [ACE](ACE.md "wikilink") devices, the FDU devices owned by you show as
a different color in the gameworld and on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink"). They can also be deconstructed by
double clicking on their icon on the continental map and selecting to
deconstruct them.
