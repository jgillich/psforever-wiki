**Tank Shell (150mm)**

These tank shells are used by the [Vanguard](Vanguard.md). They
do massive damage to infantry and armor alike, though the heavy shells
have a slow velocity. The boxes can be obtained from any [Equipment
Terminal](Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
Vanguard's [trunk](trunk.md) or acquired while in the vehicle
from a [Repair/Rearm Silo](Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
