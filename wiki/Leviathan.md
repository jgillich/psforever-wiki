**Leviathan**

The _Leviathan_ is the Vanu Sovereignty's heavy troop transport vehicle.
It features 2 75mm and 2 [Flux Cannons](Flux_Cannon.md) on the
top and 2 [Ballguns](Ballgun.md) on the side. The Leviathan can
pass through enemy [Shield Module](Shield_Module.md) defenses.

The Flux Cannons are different than that fired from the
[Thresher](Thresher.md) in that the projectile speed is
significantly faster, but the damage is slightly reduced and has no
splash damage. They are best used against enemy vehicles and aircraft,
not infantry.

The driver can wear up to [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) armor. The driver also has
access to an [EMP](EMP.md) blast (default key: "b"). The
capacitor must recharge before it can be fired again. The capacitor
status is shown on the [HUD](Heads-up_Display.md) bar. The driver can also
activate the vehicle horn (default key: "f").

The side [Ballguns](Ballgun.md) have a limited view, but if the
user has the [Darklight](Darklight.md)
[Implant](Implants.md), he/she can see
[cloaked](Infiltration_Suit.md) enemies at a longer range than
normal, providing excellent side defense.
