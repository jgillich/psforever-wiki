[Meteors](/Meteor "wikilink") are rare phenomena that can occur on any
[continent](/continent "wikilink"). They are large rocks that hit the
ground and do a large amount of damage to anything nearby. Only very
heavily armored vehicles such as [BFRs](/BFR "wikilink") and [Galaxy
Gunships](/Galaxy_Gunship "wikilink") can survive a direct hit.

Meteors are only generated when a [SOE](/SOE "wikilink") GM is online.
Meteor showers can be called in a general area and affect a large area.
Single meteors can also be called and directed at players the GM
dislikes at the time. The most common use for meteors is to add
atmosphere to a special [event](/event "wikilink") or to generally annoy
the players in a large battle.
