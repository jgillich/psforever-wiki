[Meteors](Meteor.md "wikilink") are rare phenomena that can occur on any
[continent](continent.md "wikilink"). They are large rocks that hit the
ground and do a large amount of damage to anything nearby. Only very
heavily armored vehicles such as [BFRs](BFR.md "wikilink") and [Galaxy
Gunships](Galaxy_Gunship.md "wikilink") can survive a direct hit.

Meteors are only generated when a [SOE](SOE.md "wikilink") GM is online.
Meteor showers can be called in a general area and affect a large area.
Single meteors can also be called and directed at players the GM
dislikes at the time. The most common use for meteors is to add
atmosphere to a special [event](event.md "wikilink") or to generally annoy
the players in a large battle.
