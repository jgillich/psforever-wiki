## Description

Unlike the [Air Tower](Air_tower.md) and [Gun
Tower](Gun_tower.md), the Watch Tower has no
[Phalanx](Phalanx.md) Wall Turrets.

Standing five stories tall, the Watch Tower is the tallest of all 3
[Tower](Tower.md) types. [VS](VS.md) [MAX
Units](MAX.md) must use both their regular jump and their jump
jet special ability at the same time to reach the roof directly, though
it is still rare to find a [VS](VS.md) [MAX
Unit](MAX.md) at the top of a Watch Tower given level
surrounding terrain.

As is the case with all [Towers](Tower.md), the [Spawn
Room](Spawn_room.md) in Watch Towers include two [Spawn
tubes](Spawn_tube.md), three [Equipment
Terminals](Equipment_Terminal.md), and two banks of
[Lockers](Locker.md).

## Special Capability

Watch towers have a sensor array on the roof, making them capable of
sensing enemy presence, which will display on the [Tactical
Overlay](Tactical_Overlay.md).
