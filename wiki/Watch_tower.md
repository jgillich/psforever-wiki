## Description

Unlike the [Air Tower](/Air_tower "wikilink") and [Gun
Tower](/Gun_tower "wikilink"), the Watch Tower has no
[Phalanx](/Phalanx "wikilink") Wall Turrets.

Standing five stories tall, the Watch Tower is the tallest of all 3
[Tower](/Tower "wikilink") types. [VS](/VS "wikilink") [MAX
Units](/MAX "wikilink") must use both their regular jump and their jump
jet special ability at the same time to reach the roof directly, though
it is still rare to find a [VS](/VS "wikilink") [MAX
Unit](/MAX "wikilink") at the top of a Watch Tower given level
surrounding terrain.

As is the case with all [Towers](/Tower "wikilink"), the [Spawn
Room](/Spawn_room "wikilink") in Watch Towers include two [Spawn
tubes](/Spawn_tube "wikilink"), three [Equipment
Terminals](/Equipment_Terminal "wikilink"), and two banks of
[Lockers](/Locker "wikilink").

## Special Capability

Watch towers have a sensor array on the roof, making them capable of
sensing enemy presence, which will display on the [Tactical
Overlay](/Tactical_Overlay "wikilink").
