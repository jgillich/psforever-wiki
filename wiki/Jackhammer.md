**Jackhammer**

The Jackhammer is a powerful, three-barrel heavy assault shotgun. With a
larger magazine capacity than the [Sweeper](Sweeper.md)
pump-action shotgun and a higher rate of fire in semi-auto primary mode,
it is very powerful in close-quarters combat, although its effectiveness
rapidly drops off with range. The secondary mode fires all three barrels
in very rapid succession. However, the secondary mode does less damage
per shot (and thus will not kill a fully armored soldier wearing
[Reinforced Exo-Suit](Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) armor in one
blast), and requires a longer delay before firing again as all barrels
must be reloaded.

Shots to kill (Close to Medium Range):
