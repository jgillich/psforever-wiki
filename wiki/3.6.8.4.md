Version 3.6.8.4, released May 27, 2005.

## Gameplay Fixes

- Adjusted text strings to refer to the HSR as the "[Heavy Scout
  Rifle](/Heavy_Scout_Rifle "wikilink")"
- Modified [HSR](/Heavy_Scout_Rifle "wikilink") [Cone of
  Fire](/Cone_of_fire "wikilink") properties to have it better fit its
  intended multi-role capabilities as a good medium to long range
  weapon, with better in close range performance over the [Bolt
  Driver](/Bolt_Driver "wikilink").
- Adjusted [wall turrets](/Phalanx "wikilink") to have a less damaging
  explosion.
- Adjusted aircraft ascent and descent performance as follows:
  - [Mosquito](/Mosquito "wikilink"): near instant response to
    reflect its nimble design.
  - [Reaver](/Reaver "wikilink"): close to the
    [Mosquito](/Mosquito "wikilink"), but slightly less responsive,
    due to its heavier frame.
  - [Liberator](/Liberator "wikilink"),
    [Lodestar](/Lodestar "wikilink") and [Galaxy](/Galaxy "wikilink"):
    slower responses to control, but they have slightly better
    overall thrust for a bit faster ascent and descent
