Considered an upgrade from a normal [warpgate](warpgate.md "wikilink"),
broadcast warpgates help Empires shorten the length of travel to the
battlefront by allowing forces to teleport from one warpgate to another
along the [Galactic Lattice](Galactic_Lattice.md "wikilink") and
[Continental Lattice](Lattice.md "wikilink").

These gates are actived by a [locked
continent](continent_lock.md "wikilink") or an Empire's
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink"). Any warpgate physically linked to
this continent becomes broadcast-capable.

If no broadcast link is available, entering the warpgate beam will
simply transport you to the continent that gate is hard-linked to.
