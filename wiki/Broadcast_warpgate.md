Considered an upgrade from a normal [warpgate](/warpgate "wikilink"),
broadcast warpgates help Empires shorten the length of travel to the
battlefront by allowing forces to teleport from one warpgate to another
along the [Galactic Lattice](/Galactic_Lattice "wikilink") and
[Continental Lattice](/Lattice "wikilink").

These gates are actived by a [locked
continent](/continent_lock "wikilink") or an Empire's
[Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink"). Any warpgate physically linked to
this continent becomes broadcast-capable.

If no broadcast link is available, entering the warpgate beam will
simply transport you to the continent that gate is hard-linked to.
