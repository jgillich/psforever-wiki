## Niven's Notes: Striker

(See also: [Striker](Striker.md "wikilink"))

The Striker has perhaps the most flexibilty of the four infantry-based
AV weapon systems, equally able to tackle MAX, Ground and Air targets.
Some notes to help use it:

- **Not Fire and Forget**: A common misconception among NC and VS
  troops is the Striker is point and click. While the tracking system
  does mean the rocket will home in on the target, the target must be
  kept in the reticule to guide the rocket all the way in, to be sure
  of a hit. The nearest equivalent is the
  [Starfire](Starfire.md "wikilink") MAX weapon system.

<!-- -->

- **Range**: The Stiker will not lock on to targets more than 250m
  away. Also, the rocket itself, if Dumbfired, will tend to timeout
  (explode) at this distance anyway. Do not waste rockets on
  [Liberators](Liberator.md "wikilink") at the flight ceiling, you will
  not hit, unless at a very high altitude base
  ([Searhus](Searhus.md "wikilink") Crater,
  [Ceryshen](Ceryshen.md "wikilink") Mesas).

<!-- -->

- **Reloads**: Most AV targets will require _at least_ one full
  clip (5) of rockets, meaning that anything larger that a MAX unit
  will need a reload to kill, dangerously increasing the TTK required.
  Try to plan accordingly, and always reload after each salvo; don't
  holster a half-full Striker.

<!-- -->

- **Outdoor Only**: While the Striker _can_ be used indoors, as a
  general rule the [Decimator](Decimator.md "wikilink") is a better
  choice for close-quarter battles against MAX units and
  Spawn/Generator destruction. The Decimator does much more damage per
  shot, and you are unlikely to survive for more than two shots in
  front of an AI MAX. Change loadout before going inside, if possible.

<!-- -->

- **Not AI**: The Striker _can_ kill non-MAX Infantry eventually, but
  not before they kill you with almost any MA/HA/SA weapon. A Striker
  is best used with a second choice of weapon; even pistols or
  handheld grenades provide better Anti-Infantry effectiveness.

<!-- -->

- **Best Used In Packs**: Realistically, the lone Striker user can
  only expect to solo-kill MAX, Air Cavalry, ATV and Lightning
  Vehicles. Larger units may be driven off, but are equally likely to
  take the hits and return fire, and even deployed AMS can present
  problems due to spawning. In packs however, the Striker can dominate
  outdoor battle areas; 2+ Strikers will threaten Medium Battle Tanks,
  and 5+ will drive off or destory BFRs. Co-ordination is the key
  though; if you have a Striker and see another Striker user firing,
  find his target and help him out. There is no 'kill-stealing' in
  Planetside and alone, neither of you are likely to get the kill.
  Kills in this manner tend to average out, as it is largely random
  who gets the last rocket in.

<!-- -->

- **Use From Cover**: Striker users are quickly singled out by tank
  gunners and Air Cav pilots, so make sure you have something solid to
  hide behind; trees, rocks, base walls and doors. Have an escape
  route ready if you can. Where possible, watch the vehicle for a few
  seconds before opening fire. Choosing a moment when the vehicle is
  busy elsewhere before firing can greatly improve chances of survival
  and a kill. Once the vehicle knows where you are, you typically have
  seconds (One clip; 5 shots) to either destroy it or force it to
  flee, before being killed. Having the Striker set to Dumbfire until
  you're ready to open fire can increase the element of suprise
  further, by preventing the tell-tale 'Missile Lock' warning until
  you're ready to actually fire.

<!-- -->

- **Run And Gun**: The Striker has no appreciable [Cone of
  Fire](Cone_of_Fire.md "wikilink") bloom, and can be used just as
  effectively while running and strafing, as crouching, so if you
  _have_ been spotted, you can make it more difficult for them to
  return fire. If you drive a vehicle off, but fail to kill it,
  relocate to a new position as soon as is practical; he knows where
  you are, knows you are a threat and will probably be back from an
  different direction. This is demonstrated by the 'Reaver Rocketspam
  Foxtrot', whereby the Striker user runs toward, then under the
  craft, firing all the while, thereby dodging the worst of the hits.
  This works more times than you might think.

<!-- -->

- **Inventory Management**: Striker ammo boxes are 4x4 in size, so
  present difficulties in inventory management. However, it is unlikey
  any Striker user will need to carry more than three boxes (45 shots,
  9 reloads) in Rexo. You'll either be dead before they are all used,
  or near enough a base, tower or AMS during that time, to resupply.
  Often two boxes is enough, allowing room for secondary weapon ammo,
  and support items. (This holds true for [Lancer](Lancer.md "wikilink")
  and [Phoenix](Phoenix.md "wikilink") users too.)

<!-- -->

- **Useful When Empty**: Unlike the other AV weapons, the Striker
  remains useful even when exhausted. Any vehicle being locked by the
  Striker recieves a big red 'Missle Lock' warning indicator, with
  alarming noises. This is effective in scaring away Air Cavalry and
  Light Ground units in many cases, even if no rockets are launched.

<!-- -->

- **CE Clearance**: The Striker will lock on and destroy Spitfire
  Turrets in one shot, and in Secondary (Dumbfire) mode can safely
  destory mines, boomers and motion sensors, in one shot each. The
  Striker is suitable for destroying Phalanx turrets from a safe range
  as well. Useful if EMP is unavailable.

<!-- -->

- **Other Gear**: Striker users will need a backup weapon for
  Anti-Infantry work; the [Medium Assault](Medium_Assault.md "wikilink")
  Category is ideal for this, in particular the
  [Punisher](Punisher.md "wikilink") (EMP), and the
  [Sweeper](Sweeper.md "wikilink"). [Engineering](Engineering.md "wikilink")
  ([BANK](BANK.md "wikilink")) will be useful to patch up splash damage
  and rocket spam, as the Striker tends to attract a lot of this.
  [Combat Engineering](Combat_Engineering.md "wikilink") compliments AV
  well, creating a well-rounded Anti Vehicle Specialist. [Special
  Assault](Special_Assault.md "wikilink") provides access to the EMP
  loaded [Thumper](Thumper.md "wikilink"), which can disrupt vehicle
  guns, prior to oppening fire with the Striker. At a pinch, handheld
  [Jammer grenades](Jammer_grenade.md "wikilink") can help, but require
  far more practice to land well. [Enhanced
  Targeting](Enhanced_Targeting.md "wikilink") is the single most useful
  implant for a dedicated Striker user, allowing progress to be
  measured and weaker vehicles to be picked off. [Personal
  Shield](Personal_Shield.md "wikilink") can provide a few extra crucial
  seconds to get the last rockets in, and [Surge](Surge.md "wikilink")
  can help the AV trooper to get to cover if it goes wrong.
  [Reinforced Exo-Suit](Reinforced_Exo.$1.md "wikilink") allows a much
  needed back-up rifle slot, and greater survivability outdoors.

<!-- -->

- **Don't Give Up!**: AV weapons do not generally yield the same sheer
  quantity of kills and xp as HA, and you are basically getting in the
  way of tanks, on foot, so you _will_ die lots. However the AV cert
  makes up for it in quality of kills, and getting that last rocket in
  on an enemy BFR can be an immensely satisfying experience.
  Regardless, AV does help your Empire, and the more people that carry
  it, the more powerful it becomes. And remember, even just driving
  the tank away to repair is still a victory, as that is time he is
  not spending farming your grunts.

**Countering The Striker:**

- **Location**: The key to dealing with the Striker, is know where it
  is. Head to head, from a standing start, in an open field, the
  Striker user will lose to just about everything but MAX units, and
  even that might be touch and go. The Striker relies on suprise, and
  the inital confusion before his position is revealed, to cause
  signficant damage. Once he is spotted, the fight turns against him
  very quickly, but by this point, sufficient damage may have been
  caused to make it academic. Approach the combat area slowly and only
  charge once a Striker position has been confirmed. Air Cavalry
  should always try to have a full tank of
  [Afterburner](Afterburner.md "wikilink") ready, as this will allow the
  fragile [Mosquito](Mosquito.md "wikilink") and
  [Reaver](Reaver.md "wikilink") to outrun Striker missiles to safety.
  Less disciplined Striker users will tend to fire at anything and
  everything as soon as it comes into range, and this can pinpoint
  them quickly to the patient and observant. Striker rockets in flight
  show as red dashes on the proximity map, giving further clues.

<!-- -->

- **Line of Sight**: The Striker actually locks to a very small point
  in the centre of the vehicle. This means an object as narrow as a
  single tree can cause the lock to be lost. If under fire, with no
  immediate opportunity to kill the Striker user, head for trees, low
  hills, rocks, buildings, even other friendly vehicles, and get them
  between you and the Striker. Reaquisition of lock takes a second or
  so, so a vehicle going full-tilt through a forest becomes virtually
  impossible to track.

<!-- -->

- **Avoid Dense Troops**: Around 20% of all TR troops have AV
  certified, so a fair assumption would be that every fifth TR grunt
  outdoors is carrying a Striker, and many others will be carrying
  some form of EMP. Charging into a dense pack of such troops is
  asking for trouble, especially by air, or in slow ground vehicles.
  Instead, work at the edges and hit and fade. Locate and pick off
  lone Striker users that stray from the herd too much; most vehicles
  stand a reasonable chance against a single Striker.

<!-- -->

- **Infiltrate**: Striker users generally tend to focus on the sky and
  horizon, and so can be more vulnerable than most troops to cloaker
  attack via AMP, Boomer or Knife. Time the attack with their own, as
  the noise from the Striker will mask any noises your initial attack
  may make.

<!-- -->

- **Range**: As noted above; vehicles are safe beyond 250m. Many
  vehicle guns are capable of longer ranges, particularly arcing
  projectiles, such as the [Vanguard](Vanguard.md "wikilink") main gun.
  Use these to retaliate in saftey.

<!-- -->

- **Send In The Grunts**: With the Striker occupying one rifle slot
  and a backpack full of very big boxes, even Rexo Striker users are
  already at a disadvantage against dedicated HA/SA infantry. Send
  squadmates or outfit members in to help distract and flush the
  Striker's position.

<!-- -->

- **Run MAX, Run**: In most cases, the MAX is likely to lose against
  the Striker, given enough distance, and suprise. The best defence
  for the MAX is cover; if in run-mode, stay in run-mode. You aren't
  any more difficult to track, but may be able to make it to trees or
  cover faster. Walking MAX should try to return fire if within range,
  particularly AI MAX, but are likely to be killed first unless within
  20-30m or so. NC MAX can use the shield to buy more time to reach
  cover, but in most cases for VS MAX, using the jumpjet is exactly
  the wrong thing to do. Stay on the ground, and seek cover, as you
  are much easier to hit in mid-air.

<!-- -->

- **Angle of Attack**: Particularly useful for Air Cavalry, if the
  location of the Striker is known (above), the best way to elimiate
  him is by aproaching low from an unexpected direction, ideally over
  a ridgetop, away from the main battle area, and cutting them down
  from behind. The machine guns, used from range, work best as there
  is less tell-tale engine or rocket launch sounds to give the game
  away.
