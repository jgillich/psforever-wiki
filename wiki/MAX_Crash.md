[Tower](Towers.md)\]\] The MAX Crash is an armored-infantry-based
rapid-ingress assault tactic.

A large group of soldiers wearing [MAX](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) suits charges a
[Facility](Facilities.md), usually the [Back
Door](Back_Door.md), and attempts to breach defenses in Auto-run
mode.

Usually this requires a significant group, as the MAXes are unable to
open locked [IFF](IFF.md) panels or fire their weapons in
auto-run mode.
