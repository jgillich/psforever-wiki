## EMP (ElectroMagnetic Pulse)

The EMP is a command ability that any soldier with
[Command Rank](../terminology/Command_Rank.md) 3 or higher can access using
their [Command Uplink Device (or CUD)](../weapons/Command_Uplink_Device.md), the
range depends on the users Command Rank however.

- Command Rank 3: 10 meter radius
- Command Rank 4: 15 meter radius
- Command Rank 5: 20 meter radius

An EMP can also be triggered by a charged
[BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md)
[NTU Siphon](../weapons/NTU_Siphon.md) and by the drivers of a
[Leviathan](../vehicles/Leviathan.md), [Juggernaut](../vehicles/Juggernaut.md),
or [Vindicator](../vehicles/Vindicator.md).

Once triggered, this ability detonates a blast that doesn't harm soldiers, but
detonates [Mines](#High_Explosive_Mine),
[Boomers](<#Remote-Detonated_Charge_(Boomer)>), and disables
[Spitfire Turrets](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Spitfire_Turret),
[Shadow Turrets](../weapons/Shadow_Turret.md),
[Cerberus Turrets](../weapons/Cerberus_Turret.md),
[Wall Turrets](../items/Phalanx.md) and
[Motion Sensors](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Motion_Sensor_Alarm).
It also disables all [Implants](../implants/Implants.md) and
[Proximity Maps](../terminology/Proximity_Map.md) of any enemy soldiers in the
area, as well as the weapons of all vehicles nearby, excluding
[BFRs](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md), the Blast does damage the BFR
systems however.

It is often utilized when clearing large fields of
[Combat Engineering (or CE)](../certifications/Combat_Engineering.md) whenever a
force is attacking a base, or a small team is commencing an insertion into an
enemy base at a heavily CE-ed entrance.

The recharge time for an EMP is 20 minutes.
