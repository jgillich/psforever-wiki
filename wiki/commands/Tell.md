A Private Message to a Player.

Used by typing

`/t`<playername>`<message>`

in your Chat Panel.

To send a /tell in response to a previous /tell, you can use /r, /reply,
or the backspace key and omit the name from the command.

You can send a tell to a player on another server by prefixing the
server name (e.g. werner.playername). You can also communicate between
[SOE](../etc/Sony_Online_Entertainment.md) games by prefixing the game (e.g. swg.playername
for StarWars Galaxies and eq2.playername for EverQuest 2).
