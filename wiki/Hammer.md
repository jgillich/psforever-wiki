**Hammer**

The Hammer is a serious anti-infantry weapon, firing a wide spread of
shredding pellets over a short range. The secondary fire mode
concentrates the pellets for medium range work, but at the cost of
firing fewer pellets per shot. While the weapon is lethal to infantry
targets, it lacks punch to beat quickly through heavy armored vehicles.

This is the only [BFR](/BFR "wikilink") pilot weapon that has 2 modes,
and in the secondary mode, crouching makes the biggest difference as for
the Cone of Fire tightening of all pilot weapons.
