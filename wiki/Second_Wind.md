The [Second Wind](/Second_Wind "wikilink") Implant provides an emergency
reserve of [Health](/Health "wikilink") and [Stamina](/Stamina "wikilink")
which can revive a soldier from near-death, and provide time to find
proper medical attention.

It is always active when installed and
[intialized](/Initialization_timer "wikilink"). It is automatically
triggered when the user's health drops below a certain critical level,
and provides a one-shot boost of 25 [Health](/Health "wikilink") and 25
[Stamina](/Stamina "wikilink"), and then must reinitialize again.

Second Wind has the longest [initialization
timer](/initialization_timer "wikilink") of any implant.
