The [Second Wind](Second_Wind.md "wikilink") Implant provides an emergency
reserve of [Health](Health.md "wikilink") and [Stamina](Stamina.md "wikilink")
which can revive a soldier from near-death, and provide time to find
proper medical attention.

It is always active when installed and
[intialized](Initialization_timer.md "wikilink"). It is automatically
triggered when the user's health drops below a certain critical level,
and provides a one-shot boost of 25 [Health](Health.md "wikilink") and 25
[Stamina](Stamina.md "wikilink"), and then must reinitialize again.

Second Wind has the longest [initialization
timer](initialization_timer.md "wikilink") of any implant.
