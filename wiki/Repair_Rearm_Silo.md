The **Repair/Rearm Silo** is a large cylindrical structure attached to
two walls in each continent's [surface
bases](Facilities.md#Surface_Bases), and to the [HART
buildings](HART_building.md) in each
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md). They can be used to rearm ground
[vehicles](Vehicle.md) and [BFRs](BattleFrame_Robotics.md), as long as
the base is powered and in friendly hands. Also, when the facility is
linked to a friendly [Dropship Center](Dropship_Center.md) or
your empire has the [Oshur](Oshur.md) [Continental
lock](Continental_lock.md), they will automatically repair most
friendly vehicles and BFRs that approach them. [Flail](Flail.md)
and [Switchblades](Switchblade.md) require the [Vehicle
Module](Vehicle_Module.md) benefit to repair and recharge at
these terminals.

Also sometimes referred to as a _Ground Repair/Rearm.md Station_ or _Repair
Terminal_.
