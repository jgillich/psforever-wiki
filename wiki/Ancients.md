The **Ancients** are alien beings, originally referred to as the Vanu,
believed to be the creators of the [Auraxis](Auraxis.md "wikilink")
construct, the [Auraxian Core](Auraxian_Core.md "wikilink"), the
[warpgates](warpgate.md "wikilink") and [lattice](lattice.md "wikilink"), the
[rebirth](respawn.md "wikilink") and [nanite](NTU.md "wikilink") technology,
and the _Wormhole_ that brought us here.

Upon discovering the [caverns](caverns.md "wikilink") of Auraxis, we got a
glimpse of where the Ancients must have lived or worked. They left
behind artifacts and residual energy signatures for [Ancient
Technology](Ancient_Technology.md "wikilink") that we have been able to
adapt to our own needs.

The appearance, motives, and whereabouts of the Ancients are a complete
mystery. As revealed by [The Bending](The_Bending.md "wikilink") it is
thought that the Ancients were masters of manipulating space-time, able
to move or alter different dimensions and realities through complex
technology. It is this technology that has allowed us to cheat death in
our wars. Sadly, this immortality is not without a price. We have become
slaves to the Ancients' creations, bound to each
[planet](planet.md "wikilink") and cavern by the fear of final death.

The Ancients are the most powerful beings in the known universe. We must
harness their power if we are return to Earth and defend all humanity
against them or their enemies. This is our purpose and our curse and we
cannot fail.
