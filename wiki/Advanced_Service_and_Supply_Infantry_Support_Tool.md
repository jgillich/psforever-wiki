The [Advanced Service and Supply Infantry Support
Tool](Advanced_Service_and_Supply_Infantry_Support_Tool "wikilink")
(ASSIST) is for dedicated support players who have proved their worth in
both the medical and engineering fields of support. This device combines
the [Body Armor Nano Kit](Body_Armor_Nano_Kit "wikilink") along with the
[Medical Applicator](Medical_Applicator "wikilink") to create a single
tool which performs both roles.

However, the tool is not as good as the [Body Armor Nano
Kit](Body_Armor_Nano_Kit "wikilink") or the [Medical
Applicator](Medical_Applicator "wikilink") alone. It repairs 10 armor
and 8 health at the cost of one unit of ammunition at the same time. The
advantage over the [Body Armor Nano Kit](Body_Armor_Nano_Kit "wikilink")
and the [Medical Applicator](Medical_Applicator "wikilink") is that it
repairs and heals at the same time.

Also, the Advanced Service and Supply Infantry Support Tool can revive
if the user has the [Advanced Medical](Advanced_Medical "wikilink")
certification. It takes 30 units of ammo to revive someone.
