[Auraxis](Auraxis "wikilink") is the name of the "construct" in which
[PlanetSide's story](Planetside_Backstory "wikilink") play takes place.
Initially, it was a planet-like body of ten
[continents](continent "wikilink") colonized by the [Terran
Republic](Terran_Republic "wikilink"). After [The
Bending](The_Bending "wikilink") however, it became a set of
interconnected [planets](planet "wikilink") and moons, with the [warp
gates](warpgate "wikilink") allowing PlanetSide soldiers to cross
galactic distances.

The creators of Auraxis are known as the Ancient Vanu or simply the
[Ancients](Ancients "wikilink").

The planets/continents which make up Auraxis are:

There are also six [Caverns](Caverns "wikilink") deep in other planetary

Combat](Core_Combat "wikilink") expansion. Only two are accessible at
any one time.
