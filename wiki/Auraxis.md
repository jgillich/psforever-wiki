[Auraxis](Auraxis.md "wikilink") is the name of the "construct" in which
[PlanetSide's story](Planetside_Backstory.md "wikilink") play takes place.
Initially, it was a planet-like body of ten
[continents](continent.md "wikilink") colonized by the [Terran
Republic](Terran_Republic.md "wikilink"). After [The
Bending](The_Bending.md "wikilink") however, it became a set of
interconnected [planets](planet.md "wikilink") and moons, with the [warp
gates](warpgate.md "wikilink") allowing PlanetSide soldiers to cross
galactic distances.

The creators of Auraxis are known as the Ancient Vanu or simply the
[Ancients](Ancients.md "wikilink").

The planets/continents which make up Auraxis are:

- [Amerish](Amerish.md "wikilink")
- [Ceryshen](Ceryshen.md "wikilink")
- [Cyssor](Cyssor.md "wikilink")
- [Esamir](Esamir.md "wikilink")
- [Forseral](Forseral.md "wikilink")
- [Hossin](Hossin.md "wikilink")
- [Ishundar](Ishundar.md "wikilink")
- [Searhus](Searhus.md "wikilink")
- [Solsar](Solsar.md "wikilink")
- [Oshur Battle Islands](Oshur.md "wikilink")

There are also six [Caverns](Caverns.md "wikilink") deep in other planetary
bodies. These were introduced with the [Core
Combat](Core_Combat.md "wikilink") expansion. Only two are accessible at
any one time.

- [Adlivun](Adlivun.md "wikilink")
- [Annwn](Annwn.md "wikilink")
- [Byblos](Byblos.md "wikilink")
- [Drugaskan](Drugaskan.md "wikilink")
- [Hunhau](Hunhau.md "wikilink")
- [Supai](Supai.md "wikilink")

In addition to these, each [Empire](Empire.md "wikilink") has its own
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink") where weapons are disabled and enemy
troops cannot enter.
