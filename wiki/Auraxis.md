[Auraxis](Auraxis.md) is the name of the "construct" in which
[PlanetSide's story](Planetside_Backstory.md) play takes place.
Initially, it was a planet-like body of ten
[continents](continent.md) colonized by the [Terran
Republic](Terran_Republic.md). After [The
Bending](The_Bending.md) however, it became a set of
interconnected [planets](planet.md) and moons, with the [warp
gates](warpgate.md) allowing PlanetSide soldiers to cross
galactic distances.

The creators of Auraxis are known as the Ancient Vanu or simply the
[Ancients](Ancients.md).

The planets/continents which make up Auraxis are:

- [Amerish](Amerish.md)
- [Ceryshen](Ceryshen.md)
- [Cyssor](Cyssor.md)
- [Esamir](Esamir.md)
- [Forseral](Forseral.md)
- [Hossin](Hossin.md)
- [Ishundar](Ishundar.md)
- [Searhus](Searhus.md)
- [Solsar](Solsar.md)
- [Oshur Battle Islands](Oshur.md)

There are also six [Caverns](Caverns.md) deep in other planetary
bodies. These were introduced with the [Core
Combat](Core_Combat.md) expansion. Only two are accessible at
any one time.

- [Adlivun](Adlivun.md)
- [Annwn](Annwn.md)
- [Byblos](Byblos.md)
- [Drugaskan](Drugaskan.md)
- [Hunhau](Hunhau.md)
- [Supai](Supai.md)

In addition to these, each [Empire](Empire.md) has its own
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md) where weapons are disabled and enemy
troops cannot enter.
