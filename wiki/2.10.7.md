Live Version 2.10.7 (August 16, 2004)

[Battle Islands](Battle_Islands.md "wikilink") are now Live. The [Global
Map](Global_Map.md "wikilink") Interface has been changed to accomodate the
new Battle Islands. [Warpgates](Warpgate.md "wikilink") now work on a
hybrid system, with one warpgate on each
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md "wikilink"), permanently connecting to one [Home
Continent](Home_Continent.md "wikilink") and Broadcast Warpgates connecting
to others across the world.
