Refering to the six subterranean battlegrounds introduced with the
expansion [Core Combat](/Core_Combat "wikilink"). Each cavern once rested
beneath a continent on the main planet of Auraxis. After [The
Bending](/The_Bending "wikilink"), these caves now exist in the cores of
gigantic rogue asteroids.

The six caverns are [Adlivun](/Adlivun "wikilink"),
[Annwn](/Annwn "wikilink"), [Byblos](/Byblos "wikilink"),
[Drugaskan](/Drugaskan "wikilink"), [Hunhau](/Hunhau "wikilink"), and
[Supai](/Supai "wikilink"). Access to these caverns is controlled by
surface links to [Geowarps](/Geowarp "wikilink"). Two caverns are open at
any given time. A new carven opens every 3.5 hours, meaning each cavern
is open for a total of 7 hours at a time.

Sometimes in Game Lore the caverns are referred to as the [Auraxian
Core](/Auraxian_Core "wikilink").
