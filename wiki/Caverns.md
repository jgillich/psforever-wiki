Refering to the six subterranean battlegrounds introduced with the
expansion [Core Combat](Core_Combat.md "wikilink"). Each cavern once rested
beneath a continent on the main planet of Auraxis. After [The
Bending](The_Bending.md "wikilink"), these caves now exist in the cores of
gigantic rogue asteroids.

The six caverns are [Adlivun](Adlivun.md "wikilink"),
[Annwn](Annwn.md "wikilink"), [Byblos](Byblos.md "wikilink"),
[Drugaskan](Drugaskan.md "wikilink"), [Hunhau](Hunhau.md "wikilink"), and
[Supai](Supai.md "wikilink"). Access to these caverns is controlled by
surface links to [Geowarps](Geowarp.md "wikilink"). Two caverns are open at
any given time. A new carven opens every 3.5 hours, meaning each cavern
is open for a total of 7 hours at a time.

Sometimes in Game Lore the caverns are referred to as the [Auraxian
Core](Auraxian_Core.md "wikilink").
