![](images/Core_Complex.jpg "fig:Core_Complex.jpg") The Core Complex is the
large crystaline structure located at the center of each of the [Core
Combat](Core_Combat.md "wikilink") [Caverns](Caverns.md "wikilink").

At the center of this structre is a white column of light. Stepping into
this beam of light is fatal, with two exceptions:
![](images/Core_Beam.jpg "fig:Core_Beam.jpg")

- Soldier is carrying an uncharged [Module](Modules.md "wikilink"). The
  beam will charge the module, ready for installation in a surface
  [Facility](Facility.md "wikilink") [Module
  Cradle](Module_Cradle.md "wikilink").

<!-- -->

- Soldier is ready to [Imprint](BFR_Imprint.md "wikilink") in preparation
  for [BattleFrame Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics.md "wikilink")
  certification. Once the proper requirements have been met, the beam
  will allow soldiers to certify BFR from that point on.

While in the beam under the above two circumstances, you are immune to
damage.

Unlike the other Cavern Base Facilites, the Core Complex has no [Ancient
Control Console](Ancient_Control_Console.md "wikilink"), and cannot be
captured by any [Empire](Empire.md "wikilink").

Entry to the building is by [Zipline](Zipline.md "wikilink"), or
[Teleporter](Teleporter.md "wikilink") ring pairs. Navigation inside is
also by Teleporter.
