**Konried** was the second of two east-coast based servers (with
[Emerald](Emerald "wikilink") remaining, but now merged into
[Gemini](Gemini "wikilink")). Konried was shut down and its characters
moved to Emerald to increase falling populations on both servers. These
characters are now on Gemini. Character and [outfit](outfit "wikilink")
names that already existed on Emerald prior to the merge had a "-K"
appened to the name. These names can now be seen on Gemini.
