# Module benefit

Installed [modules](index.md) provide base benefits that can be linked to
other [facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) via the Continental
[Lattice](../terminology/Lattice.md). A facility can enjoy many module benefits
from mulitiple bases through direct and indirect chains of links.

Module benefits can be interupted if the base is [hacked](../archive/strategy/Capturing_Bases.md) by
the enemy, if the [generator](../items/Generator.md) is destroyed, or the base
runs out of [NTU](../items/NTU.md) and goes
[neutral](../terminology/Neutral.md). Any facility linked to this incapacitated
base, directly or via a chain of bases, will lose that base's module benefit.

This system is a similar one used for
[Facility Linked Benefits](../terminology/Facility_Linked_Benefit.md).

A yellow icon will appear above each base on the continental map that hosts a
module benefit.

[Cavern Locked](../terminology/Cavern_Lock.md) benefits will also link the lattice like the
module benefit. The module icon will appear green over the base with such a
link.
