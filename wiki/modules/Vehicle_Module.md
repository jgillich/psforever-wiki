Installing this [module](index.md) provides the
[module benefit](Module_benefit.md) of allowing the purchase, repair, and
capacitor recharging of [Ancient-Tech](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md)
vehicles: [Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md) and
[Switchblade](../items/Switchblade.md). The vehicles can repair at the
[Repair/Rearm Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md) and can recharge their
capacitors at either [Landing Pads](../items/Landing_Pad.md) or Repair/Rearm
Silos. Additionally, the vehicle reacquire timer for all vehicles is reduced
significantly.

Note that though the [Router](../vehicles/Router.md) is considered an
[Ancient-Tech](../terminology/Ancient_Technology.md) vehicle, it does not
require a Vehicle Module to be acquired.

This module appears as purple on the [Continental Map](../terminology/Continental_Map.md).
