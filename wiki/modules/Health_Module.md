Installing this [module](index.md) provides the
[module benefit](Module_benefit.md) of allowing soldiers that spawn to do
so with 120 health instead of 100. Additionally, friendly soldiers in the
[Sphere of Influence](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md) slowly regenerate
health over time, up to the maximum of 120, even if they started with only 100
health points.

This module appears as yellow on the
[Continental Map](../terminology/Continental_Map.md).
