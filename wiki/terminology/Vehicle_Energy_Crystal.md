[Vehicle Energy Crystals](Vehicle_Energy_Crystal.md) serve two
purposes:

- [Vehicle](../vehicles/index.md) Armor Repair
- Ancient-Tech Vehicle Ammo recharge

They will repair all vehicles but only recharge the capacitors of the
Ancient-Tech vehicles ([Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md) and
[Switchblade](../items/Switchblade.md)).
