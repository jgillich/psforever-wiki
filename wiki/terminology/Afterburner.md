An Afterburner is a secondary booster system fitted to most aircraft to
provide a short burst of extra speed in emergencies.

The Afterburner runs off a reserve energy cell, shown on the HUD next to
the [Health](Health.md) and Armor bars. Once activated (Default:
SPACE BAR), the aircraft's speed is increased by around 25%, until the
cell is depleted. The cell will recharge over time when the Afterburner
is not in use.

This speed boost is typically enough to escape most ground-based
threats, although most air-based foes are similarly equipped.

Afterburners are equipped in:

- [Galaxy](../vehicles/Galaxy.md)
- [Lodestar](../vehicles/Lodestar.md)
- [Mosquito](../vehicles/Mosquito.md)
- [Phantasm](../vehicles/Phantasm.md)
- [Reaver](../vehicles/Reaver.md)
- [Vulture](../vehicles/Vulture.md)
- [Wasp](../vehicles/Wasp.md)

(Note: The [Liberator](../vehicles/Liberator.md) does NOT have an
Afterburner system. Instead, SPACE will give the pilot a belly-camera
view of the ground below, to aid in setting up bomb runs. To compensate,
the Liberator does have a fairly powerful 25mm Chaingun in the tail.)
