The **Instant Action** command allows a player to be spawned directly into
combat from anywhere in the game.

The location a soldier is sent to is partly determined by the number and
frequency of [Hotspots](Hotspot.md) on the various
[Planet](../locations/Planet.md) maps, along with friendly population already in
place, along with [Empire Lock](Empire_Lock.md) and [Population
lock](Population_Lock.md

To use Instant Action, either type '/ia' or '/instantaction' into the chat box,
or press Esc and select from the menu.

As with [Recall](Recall.md), location affects timer:

- Friendly [SOI](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md): 10 seconds
- Neutral SOI or open country: 20 seconds
- Enemy SOI: 30 seconds

Activating Instant Action will turn off (but not uninitialize)
[implants](../implants/index.md) and deactivate cloak (if any). Moving,
jumping, cloaking or activating implants will all cancel the Instant Action
countdown.

Upon arrival, your [Personal Waypoint](Personal_Waypoint.md) will be reset to
indicate the location of the [Hotspot](Hotspot.md) that you are meant to respond
to.
