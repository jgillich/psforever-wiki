Ignored players cannot talk to you. If a player that you have on Ignore
sends you a tell, they will receive a "_That player is ignoring you_"
message. If a Player that you have on Ignore sends you a
[Squad](Squad.md)/[Platoon](Platoon.md)/[Outfit](Outfit.md)
Invite, they will receive an automatic "Invite Declined Message". If a
player you have on ignore has you on his/her [Friends
List](../commands/Friends_List.md), you will not show as online even if you
actually are.

To modify your ignore list, the following command can be used in the
chat pane:

`/ignore [add|remove]`<charactername>``

The ignore list can also be managed from the [Player
pane](Player_pane.md).

Attempting to add yourself to the ignore list will result in one of a
few entertaining messages.
