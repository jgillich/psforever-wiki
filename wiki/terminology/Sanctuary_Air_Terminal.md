All of the [empire](Empire.md) [Sanctuaries](../locations/Sanctuary.md) contain
a unique type of [Air Terminal](../items/Air_Terminal.md). This vehicular
terminal is identical, in appearance, to the terminals found in most
[Facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) except for the logo of a
[Mosquito](../vehicles/Mosquito.md) rather then a
[Harasser](../vehicles/Harasser.md). You can only pull air
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) from this terminal, not ground vehicles. The
terminal is also capable of spawning the [Galaxy](../vehicles/Galaxy.md),
[Galaxy Gunship](../vehicles/Galaxy_Gunship.md), and
[Lodestar](../vehicles/Lodestar.md).
