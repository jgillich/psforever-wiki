A **patch** is an update to the game automatically downloaded by the game client
software. They are installed by Launch Pad and apply changes to the currently
installed game files. Patches are either to fix bugs or add new features, often
both. Occasionally a patch will be used to "rollback" a feature. This is rare
and done only when something is very broken and needs to be re-done.
