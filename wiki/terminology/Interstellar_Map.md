# Interstellar Map

![](../images/InterstellarMap.jpg){ class="figure" }

Overhead Map of the
[planets](../locations/Planet.md) and of Auraxian space, showing the
[Galactic Lattice](Galactic_Lattice.md) network between the worlds and their
[continents](../locations/Continent.md). Accessed with the "G" key after you
have opened up the [Continental Map](Continental_Map.md) with the "M"
key.

When you select a single planet, it will reveal color-coded lines to other
worlds that have fixed warpgate links to it. Blue rings will encircle a planet
that you can [Broadcast Warp](Broadcast.md) to. When you enter a
[broadcast warpgate](../items/Broadcast_warpgate.md), the Interstellar Map will
automatically open and allow you to immediately choose your destination.

Planetary data such as ownership status, capitol location, and number of
[facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) will scroll from the bottom of the map.
Mini-screens at the top of the map display [Cavern](../locations/Caverns.md) and
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) status.

Selecting a planet or cavern will also highlight its hosted continent on the
side of the screen, with thin lines leading to the target world for quick
referance. Each mini-window will also show the
[Continental lock](Continental_lock.md) and [Population
lock](Population_Lock.md) status of each continent, the empire
[SOIs](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md) for each base, as well as any
[hotspots](Hotspot.md) on the surface.

[LLU](Lattice_Logic_Unit.md), [Module](../modules/index.md), [Squad](Squad.md),
and [Platoon](Platoon.md)-member locations will also display on these continent
windows. Your current location will appear as a white arrow.

Double-clicking on a continent or planet will open up the
[Continental Map](Continental_Map.md) of that world or cavern.
