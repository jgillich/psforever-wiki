[Locking](Continental_lock.md) a continent can carry with it a unique
benefit for the Empire holding that [planet](../locations/Planet.md). These
benefits apply to all facilities regardless of a
[Galactic Lattice](Galactic_Lattice.md) link.

There are currently two types of [continents](../locations/Continent.md),
[Home Continents](../locations/Home_Continent.md) and
[Neutral Continents](Neutral_Continent.md).

## Home continents

A Home Continent is on a planet directly linked to an Empire's
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md). If an Empire captures both of these
planets, they gain access to that Empire's vehicles. A linked
[Technology Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md) is still required to
purchase [Advanced Assault vehicles](../vehicles/Advanced_Assault_vehicles.md).

Home Continent Empire benefits persist until an opposing Empire recaptures and
locks one of their home continents.

## Neutral continents

A Neutral Continent/Planet is not linked to any Sanctuaries. There are currently
4 neutral planets. When an Empire locks one, they will gain the benefit
associated with it. These benefits persist until an opposing Empire recaptures
and locks the continent for their own faction.

[Oshur Battle Islands](../locations/Oshur.md) : Provides
[Dropship Center](../locations/Dropship_Center.md) benefit to all of your bases.
(i.e., vehicle repair) [Cyssor](../locations/Cyssor.md) : Provides a +10% armor
bonus to all vehicles of that empire. [Ishundar](../locations/Ishundar.md) :
Provides the [Amp Station](../locations/Amp_Station.md) benefit to all of your
bases. (i.e., vehicle shields) [Searhus](../locations/Searhus.md) : Provides the
[Bio Laboratory](../locations/Bio_Laboratory.md) benefit to all of your bases.
(i.e., faster respawn)

These benefits are sometimes called Global Benefits.
