Also known as the "Radar," the **Proximity Map** is typically located in
the top left of your [Heads-Up Display
(HUD)](../etc/Heads-up_Display.md) and shows a wealth of data.

Friendly units are displayed in Green. Enemy Units are displayed in Red.

Depending on certain variables such as [Motion
Sensors](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#Motion_Sensor_Alarm) or
control of an [Interlink Facility](Interlink.md), some
Enemy units may or may not show up on your Radar.

When you are outdoors, by default, your Proximity Map displays a map
200m in radius. When approaching a base, the zoom level changes to 100m
for an easier view of nearby troops. When you are indoors, the 50m
setting will show the layouts of the various rooms that can be found on
your current level, making navigation within
[Facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) much easier.

There are two orientation modes, toggleable via the menu:

1. Map-rotate mode, which will turn the map and always show you facing
   upwards, and
2. Player-rotate mode, which always shows North upwards and will rotate
   your arrow to indicate your heading.

If you have the [Advanced Medical](../certifications/Advanced_Medical.md)
certification and equip the [Medical
Applicator](../weapons/Medical_Applicator.md), fallen soldiers will be
shown as glowing triangles. If you are a fallen soldier, friendly
Advanced Medics holding Medical Applicators will be shown as glowing
crosses (Advanced Medics will see this as well when holding a Medical
Applicator).

Personal, Squad, and XP Waypoints will show up on your proximity map if
they are within display range, or they will indicate the direction to
them if they are not.

In the upper-left of the pane, small white text indicates your
coordinates on the continental map.

You can toggle the Map on and off from your Soldier Management Bar,
located at the bottom right of your HUD.

The **Proximity Map** is also called the Proximity Radar, Radar Map, or,
incorrectly, the [Overhead Map](terminology/Overhead_Map.md).
