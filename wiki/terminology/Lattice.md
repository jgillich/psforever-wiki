The Continental Lattice is a network of links between all
[facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) and
[warpgates](../locations/Warpgate.md) on a
[continent](../locations/Continent.md). This network determines which base is
next available for capture by each Empire. The network can be viewed on each
continent's [Continental Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md) view.

In addition, [Facility Linked Benefits](Facility_Linked_Benefit.md) and
[module benefits](../etc/Module_benefit.md) are shared along unbroken chains in
the lattice. Any disruption in this chain, be it a destroyed
[generator](../items/Generator.md), enemy hack, or a base turning neutral, will
break this link and sever the benefit.

Lattice can also refer to the [Galactic Lattice](Galactic_Lattice.md), the
interstellar network tying all the [planets](../locations/Planet.md) and
continents together. This can be viewed from the
[Interstellar Map](Interstellar_Map.md) screen.

## Lattice Colors and their Meaning

A yellow lattice link indicates a potential capture link between friendly and
enemy empires.

A red, blue, or purple link indicate a connection between two friendly bases of
an empire.

A gray link indicates a potential capture link between two enemy empires, but
not your own.

A green link indicates a [Sub-Capitol](../locations/Sub-Capitol.md) link, which
controls the [Force Dome](../items/Force_Dome.md) system for
[Continental Capitols](../locations/Capitol.md).

## Game Lore

In game fiction terms, the lattice is the web of warpgate energy shunted through
each base to allow for respawn points and the conversion of nanites into energy
for powering systems.

Before [The Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md), lattice networks sprawled between
all warpgates on a continent. After The Bending, and the appearance of the
Battle Islands, some of these warpgates have become inactive, shifting the
lattice links between bases.
