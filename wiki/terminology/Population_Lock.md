# Population Lock

A population lock is when a [continent](../locations/Continent.md) is full, and
cannot hold any more players.

They come in two varieties:

- Empire Population Lock - The maximum numbers of troops for your specific
  [empire](Empire.md) has been reached for this continent. However, the same may
  not be true for the other empire at the time.

<!-- -->

- Population Lock - Also referred to as a "hard lock." This is when the
  continent cannot fit any more troops from any and all empires. This lock is
  put in place due to hardware limitations on the continental servers, and is
  only seen during a very intense three-way battle.
