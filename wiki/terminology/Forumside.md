While comonly considered to be a simple slang method of refereing to the
[Planetside Official Forums](../etc/Planetside_Official_Forums.md), "ForumSide"
is a somewhat more detailed topic.

The true meaning of Forumside implies that spending time on the PlanetSide
Official Forums is actually more entertaining than the game itself, and
sometimes goes as far as being an addiction to some more influential members of
the community.

There are many members of the PlanetSide Official Forums who jokingly consider
themselve "ForumSiders." The humor behind this title implaies that the spend
more time posting on the boards, then they do playing the game.
