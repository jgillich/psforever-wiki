**IFF** stands for "Identify Friend from Foe". Objects that use this technology
differentiate between enemies and friendlies, allowing friendlies to activate
and use its benefits but disallowing enemies. Objects which use IFF are:

- Exterior [tower](../locations/Towers.md) and
  [facility](../locations/Facilities.md) doors, as well as
  [Control Console](../locations/Control_Console.md),
  [generator](../items/Generator.md), and
  [spawn room](../locations/Spawn_Room.md) doors.
- [Equipment terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md)
- [Medical terminals](../items/Medical_Terminal.md)
- [Lockers](../items/Lockers.md)
- [Vehicles](../vehicles/index.md)
- [Spawn tubes](../items/Respawn_Tube.md)
- Facility [Main terminals](../items/Main_Terminal.md)

Most IFF objects can be [hacked](Hack.md), temporarily disabling the IFF lock on
them and allowing all units, Friend or Foe, to access them. Notable exceptions
include vehicles, which change ownership to that of the hacking soldier, and
spawn tubes and main terminals, which cannot be hacked. Hacked IFF locks can be
re-locked by a friendly soldier using a
[REK](../weapons/Remote_Electronics_Kit.md).
