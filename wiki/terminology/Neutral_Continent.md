A **Neutral Continent** (or Neutral Planet in the
[Post-Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md) era) is simply a
[planet](../locations/Planet.md) which does not possesses a direct link to an
[Empire](Empire.md)'s [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md). Empire's must link
to these planets from other continents to gain access.

The Neural Continents are:

- [Cyssor](../locations/Cyssor.md)
- [Ishundar](../locations/Ishundar.md)
- [Searhus](../locations/Searhus.md)
- [Oshur Battle Islands](../locations/Oshur.md)

The words Planet and Continent are sometimes interchangable.
