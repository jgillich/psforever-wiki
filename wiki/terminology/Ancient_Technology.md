Ancient Technology is used to descibe anything connected with the relics left
behind by the [Ancients](Ancients.md) in the various Asteroid
[Caverns](../locations/Caverns.md), including their buildings and sentry
turrets, crystal formations, module technology, equipment and vehicles.

More specifically the following equipment is considered Ancient Technology:

Equipment:

- [Spiker](../weapons/Spiker.md)
- [Maelstrom](../weapons/Maelstrom.md)
- [Radiator](../weapons/Radiator.md)
- [Laze Pointer](../weapons/Laze_Pointer.md)
- [Telepad](../weapons/Telepad.md)

Vehicles:

- [Flail](../items/Flail.md)
- [Router](../vehicles/Router.md)
- [Switchblade](../items/Switchblade.md)

Although heavily derived from the cave artifacts, the
[BattleFrame Robotics](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) are not generally
considered to be Ancient Technology in the technical sense.
