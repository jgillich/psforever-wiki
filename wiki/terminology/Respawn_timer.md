Governs how quickly one can [respawn](Respawn.md) at a [respawn
point](spawn_point.md) after death. The lowest a timer may go is
1 second. The greatest a timer may go is 1 minute. Respawning at the
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) always has a spawn timer of zero.

The timer increases with each death, but can be reduced by staying alive
longer, with the [Bio Laboratory](../locations/Bio_Laboratory.md) or [Speed
Module](../etc/Speed_Module.md) benefit, or with an [Empire
Incentive](../etc/Empire_Incentives.md) bonus due to low population.
Selecting to spawn at an [AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) always has a shorter
respawn timer than the longest option.
