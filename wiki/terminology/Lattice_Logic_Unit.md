![](../images/LLU.jpg "fig:LLU.jpg")\]\] The **LLU** (Lattice Logic Unit) is a
small, spherical shaped object which spawns within special bases (called
LLU [bases](Facility.md)) in a space called the [Lattice Logic
Unit Socket](locations/Lattice_Logic_Unit_Socket.md) when that base is
hacked.

The [LLU](Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) must be delivered to the specified friendly
[facility](Facility.md) (indicated by the
[Lattice](../Lattice.md) link flashing on the [Continental
Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md) screen) within 15 minutes for the hack
to succeed. If the LLU contacts water, the hack is canceled. If you are
the LLU runner, the destination base will have a reddish
[waypoint](Waypoint.md) marker over it and an indicator on your
radar of the destination base.

It is always good strategy to give the LLU carrier (who retrieves it
from the Socket or ground (if dropped) by simply touching it) a ride in
a vehicle with a passenger space so as to finish the hack as soon as
possible (the LLU cannot enter the following vehicles:
[Galaxies](../vehicles/Galaxy.md), [Liberators](../Liberator.md),
[Vultures](../vehicles/Vulture.md), [Lodestars](../vehicles/Lodestar.md) or
[BattleFrame Robotics](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md)). Vehicles that
are transporting an LLU will have speed penalties, which reduces their
top speed for as long as the LLU is in it. The LLU Carrier may not pilot
any vehicles themselves, nor use a [Router](../vehicles/Router.md),
deconstruct themselves, or enter a [Warpgate](../locations/Warpgate.md)
bubble. In addition, [MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) Units are not able to pick up
and/or carry LLU's, and Cloakers will decloak while they are carrying
the LLU.

The LLU carrier must deliver the LLU to the [Control
Console](../locations/Control_Console.md) of the indicated base to capture
the hacked facility. LLU bases give [Battle Experience
Points](Battle_Experience_Points.md)/[Command Experience
Points](Command_Experience_Points.md) for being in the base
during a hack (Hack and Hold amount BEP/CEP), escorting the LLU
(determined by distance from it, closer you are to the LLU the more
BEP/CEP you will get), and for defending the base the LLU must be taken
to (least BEP/CEP).

The LLU is visable on the [map](../etc/Continental_Map.md) screen, and
proximity map and the carrier will radiate yellow waves of light while
carrying the LLU. You can drop the LLU (to give to another player) by
pressing shift-G by default. Vehicles parked on top of an LLU in the
field will be given a deconstruction warning.
