Similar to a soldier's [Inventory](Inventory.md), trunks are the compartments in
[vehicles](category:_Vehicles.md) for storing
[ammunition](../items/Ammunition.md) and supplies. Most vehicle weapons are fed
directly from the trunk, with the exceptions being the
[Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md) and [Switchblade](../items/Switchblade.md), which
use on-board capacitors for their ammunition.

Trunks are of varying size in relation to the vehicle's mass and function.

Vehicles with weapon systems have a default loadout of ammuntion for their guns
loaded into the trunk on creation, but these contents may be changed quickly at
a [Repair/Rearm Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md),
[Landing Pad](../items/Landing_Pad.md), or [Lodestar](../vehicles/Lodestar.md).
These terminals also allow depleted ammunition to be instantly restocked in the
trunk, via the vehicle [Favorites](../etc/Favorites.md) menu.

In emergencies, i.e only [Towers](../locations/Towers.md) and
[Advanced Mobile Stations](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) available,
the trunk may be manually restocked by the driver using the 'Vehicles' tab at
any standard [Equipment terminal](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md), and carrying
the appropriate boxes back to the vehicle's trunk.

The trunk may be used to carry any items at all, not just vehicle ammunition,
and as most ammo boxes are 4x4, there is usually room for extra items down the
sides: extra [Armor Canisters](../items/Armor_Canister.md),
[Adaptive Construction Engines](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md),
etc. These items will save into any vehicle Favorite preset along with the ammo,
provided you have the appropriate
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md).

(Note: The trunk may be locked like the Driver, Gunner and Passenger seats; set
to Driver only, Squad Only and Empire - remember to unlock it if you want your
gunner to do a manual reload.)

[ANTs](../vehicles/Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md) and
[AMSes](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) do not have trunks.
[Lodestars](../vehicles/Lodestar.md), [Routers](../vehicles/Router.md),
[Wraiths](../vehicles/Wraith.md), [Phantasms](../vehicles/Phantasm.md),
[Flails](../vehicles/Flail.md), and [Switchblades](../items/Switchblade.md) have
empty trunks by default.
