Each type of [base facility](../locations/Facilities.md) carries with it a
unique benefit for the Empire holding that base. These benefits can be linked to
other facilities via the [Continental Lattice](Lattice.md). A facility can enjoy
many benefits from mulitiple bases through direct and indirect chains of links.

Facility Linked Benefits, or FLB, can be interupted if the base is
[hacked](../etc/Capturing_Bases.md) by the enemy, if the
[generator](../items/Generator.md) is destroyed, a [Virus](Virus.md) is uploaded
into the [Main Terminal](../items/Main_Terminal.md), or the base runs out of
[NTU](../items/NTU.md) and goes [neutral](Neutral.md). Any facility linked to
this incapacitated base, directly or via a chain of bases, will lose that base's
benefit (except viruses, which affect only the infected base).

This system is a similar one used for [Cavern Modules](../etc/Modules.md).

Icons on the [Continental Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md) represent each type of
benefit associated or linked to that base.

## Available Facility Benefits

- [Amp Station](../locations/Amp_Station.md) - (Benefit icon: Shielded vehicle)
  Charges the shield generators of vehicles while they are in a friendly
  [Sphere of Influence (SOI)](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md).

  **Shield Generators:** Each vehicle has a shield generator installed in it.
  When they enter an Amp Station's SOI or the SOI of a facility linked to an Amp
  Station, the shield will begin charging at 5 armor/second up to its maximum
  strength, which is 20% of the vehicle's base armor. After the shield takes
  damage, it can recharge again if it is within a friendly SOI though any armor
  damage done to the vehicle will remain until it is repaired by an Engineer or
  at a Repair Panel. If a driver takes a shielded vehicle outside of the
  friendly SOI, the shield will remain, though it will not recharge if it takes
  any damage until the driver returned to an Amp Station's SOI or any SOI linked
  to an Amp Station. See [Vehicle Armor](Vehicle_Armor.md) for a list of vehicle
  shield strength and the time to fully charge the shield.

- [Bio Laboratory](../locations/Bio_Laboratory.md) - (Benefit icon:
  [Spawn tube](../items/Respawn_Tube.md)) Reduces respawn times at friendly
  linked facilities.

<!-- -->

- [Dropship Center](../locations/Dropship_Center.md) - (Benefit icon: Wrench)
  Enables the Repair ability at Vehicle
  [Repair and Rearm Stations](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).

  **Rearm and Repair pads and silos** provide a quick and easy way for vehicles
  to repair damage. Each facility is equipped with one or more aircraft
  [landing pads](../items/Landing_Pad.md) and two ground panels that will
  perform this function. When a player is in control of a vehicle, they can
  approach either the pad or panel, depending on whether they are controlling an
  aircraft or a ground vehicle, and remain stationary to begin the repair
  process. Aircraft do not need to land on the pad, but they must remain near
  the pad to be repaired. Similarly, ground vehicles will be repaired
  automatically if they remain stationary near the Repair and Rearm Panel.
  Multiple vehicles can use the pads or panels at once. (source: online manual)

  Replenishment of vehicle ammunition has since become a free feature for all
  bases, regardless of a link to a Dropship Center. See
  [Repair/Rearm Silo](../items/Repair_Rearm_Silo.md). Note:
  [Ancient Tech](Ancient_Technology.md) Vehicles ([Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md)
  and [Switchblade](../items/Switchblade.md)) require the
  [Vehicle Module](../etc/Vehicle_Module.md) benefit to be repaired and/or
  rearmed, and will not be repaired with the Dropship Center benefit alone.

<!-- -->

- [Interlink Facility](../locations/Interlink.md) - (Benefit icon: Radar)
  Enhanced RADAR abilities at all linked facilities.

  Facilities linked to an Interlink Facility will gain certain enhancements to
  their **RADAR systems**. All enemy vehicles will appear on RADAR, except for
  deployed [Advanced Mobile Stations](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md),
  [Harassers](../vehicles/Harasser.md), [Mosquitos](../vehicles/Mosquito.md),
  and [Wasps](../vehicles/Wasp.md). All running enemy infantry, including
  cloaked Infiltrators, will appear on the RADAR. Enemy infantry, including
  cloaked Infiltrators, will appear on RADAR if they are within a Spitfire
  Turret or Motion Sensor's detection radius, regardless of whether they are
  moving or not.

- [Technology Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md) - (Benefit icon: Tank)
  Provides Access to
  [Advanced Assault vehicles](../vehicles/Advanced_Assault_vehicles.md)
