![](../images/Global_Map.jpg){ class="figure" } The [Global Map](Global_Map.md)
was the way [PlanetSide](../PlanetSide.md) originally showed the ten
continents and three sanctuaries. Before [The Bending](The_Bending.md)
occurred, all of [Auraxis](../locations/Auraxis.md) was still one planet.
Therefore, the ten [continents](../locations/Continent.md) and three
[sanctuaries](../locations/Sanctuary.md) were all displayed on one map
displaying Auraxis as one world of ten continents. However, after The Bending,
Auraxis was split up into many different planets, and the Global Map was
replaced by the [Interstellar Map](Interstellar_Map.md), and the Global Map
became no longer accessible in game.

Along with the Global Map was the Cavern Map, which showed the six
[Core Combat](../items/Core_Combat.md) [Caverns](../locations/Caverns.md). These
were displayed in a circle with the active caverns shown and the time to unlock
for the other four caverns. However, with The Bending, the cavern map was
removed, as the caverns were now described as asteroids and became a part of the
Interstellar Map.

Along with the [Interstellar Map](Interstellar_Map.md) came the
[Battle Islands](../locations/Battle_Islands.md) and the removal of
[Oshur](../locations/Oshur.md).

## Advantages of the Global Map

Many players are critical of the Interstellar Map, saying that the Global Map
has certain advantages over the Interstellar Map.

### Visible Lattice

With the Global Map, some users contend that the [Lattice](Lattice.md) was more
obvious. By clicking on a continent, a player could see which continent linked
to what other continents and which [warpgates](../locations/Warpgate.md) are
used. With the Interstellar Map, a player can only tell which continents link to
each other, but must investigate the continent to find out which warpgates are
used to link two continents together.

### Population Locks

On the Global Map, [Population Locks](Population_Lock.md) were very obvious to
the user, as a population indicator for the player's [Empire](Empire.md) was
placed on every continent in Auraxis that made it obvious to the player whether
or not they could go to that continent due to population. However, with the
Interstellar Map, a player must click on each individual planet to see how many
spots are left on that particular planet.

### Traveling Weather

With the Global Map, it was obvious to a player when
[weather](Weather.md) patterns are going to move from continent to
continent. However, this is completely impossible to tell with the Interstellar
Map, and storms seem to be entirely random.

## Criticism of the Interstellar Map

Many users complain about the Interstellar Map and want the Global Map back at
least as an option over the Interstellar Map for the reasons stated above. Other
users cite this as pointless as Auraxis is not a single planet anymore, and that
the Interstellar Map performs all of the jobs that the Global Map did just fine.
