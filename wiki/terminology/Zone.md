A **Zone** is a general term referring to an individual area of the persistent
world's geography.

In terms of Server topography, a zone is supported by a server or a server
cluster working in unison, allowing characters to interact with each other
within the zone.

Entering and leaving a zone will also instruct the Client to load and unload the
graphical resources needed to display that area.

Zones in [PlanetSide](../PlanetSide.md) are referred to as
[Planets](../locations/Planet.md), [Continents](../locations/Continent.md), and
[Caverns](../locations/Caverns.md).
