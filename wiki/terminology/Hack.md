**_v._ to hack, hacked:** To use the [REK](../weapons/Remote_Electronics_Kit.md)
to gain access to terminals, doors, or to capture a
[facility](../locations/Facilities.md) not under your [Empire](Empire.md)'s
control. _"Hack the control console!"_

A facility's [Control Console](../locations/Control_Console.md) must be
**hacked** for the base and its benefits to switch to your Empire.

Any soldier can hack if they have the REK. A soldier with the
[Hacking](<../certifications/Hacking_(Certification).md>) certification will be
able to hack faster, and
[Advanced Hacking](../certifications/Advanced_Hacking.md) even more quickly.

Advanced enemy terminals such as
[Equipment terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md), and
[lockers](../items/Lockers.md) must be **hacked** by an
[Advanced Hacker](../certifications/Advanced_Hacking.md) for friendlies to use
them.

**_n._ a hack:** In reference to _a)_ the status of a base when a hacker has
accessed the control console and is trying to capture the facility or _b)_ the
base's hack timer after such an event has occured. _"How long on the hack?"_
