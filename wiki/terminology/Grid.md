To aid navigation, each [Continental](../locations/Continent.md) and
[Cavern](../locations/Caverns.md) [map](../etc/Continental_Map.md) is divided
into a **grid** of squares.

Each grid location is referenced by "letter-number", with letters
starting at _A_ and going from left to right, with numbers starting with
_1_ going from top to bottom. Therefore, the top left corner is _A1_.

The actual area of each square varies by map.

Additionally, the grid coordinates for the square you are currently in
is displayed in your [Proximity Map](Proximity_Map.md), and the
locations of [squad](Squad.md) and [platoon](Platoon.md)
members is displayed under their name on the [HUD](../etc/Heads-up_Display.md).
