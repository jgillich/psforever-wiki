There are three types of Teleporter in Planetside.

- Sanctuary Virtual Transit Link

Each [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md) Island is divided into three
[HART](HART.md) complexes. These columns, located at each corner of the
[HART building](../locations/HART_building.md), allow instant travel between
each complex. These are one-way, but operate cyclically, so just keep stepping
into the column until you are at the complex you want.

These same teleporters are used in the
[VR Training](../locations/VR_Training.md) areas and allow access to the vehicle
range, shooting range, and exit from virtual reality.

- Ancient Technology Cave Teleporter Rings

The [Core Combat](../items/Core_Combat.md) [Caverns](../locations/Caverns.md)
are dotted with glowing ring-pairs at strategic places on the floor. These are
one-way travel from a cyan ring, to it's matching purple ring, and are typically
used instead of stairs in Core buildings, and are only found in the caves, not
above ground. Note: if you are still on top of the destination telepad when an
enemy unit transports on top of you, you will be killed, and
[BEP](Battle_Experience_Points.md) awarded to the enemy. This is a tactic
sometimes used by enemy cloakers to kill you instantly (without firing).

- Router Telepad

A deployed [Router](../vehicles/Router.md) and correctly placed
[Telepad](../weapons/Telepad.md) form an instantaneous link between them,
accessed by stepping into either the beam beneath the
[Router](../vehicles/Router.md) itself, or the floating telepad dome at the
other end. This link allows for two-way travel.
