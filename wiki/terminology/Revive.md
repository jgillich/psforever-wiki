A [revive](Revive.md) allows a soldier whose [health](Health.md) has hit 0 to be
brought back into combat without the need of being
[respawned](Respawn.md). This allows for a soldier to get back into
the combat more quickly, and it also allows a soldier to avoid having his
respawn time lengethening due to frequent deaths. However, a soldier who is
revived has the same [stamina](Stamina.md) and armor as when they died, so
often, a soldier's armor needs to be repaired and the soldier needs to rest for
awhile to regain their stamina.

To revive a fallen comrade, a player needs the
[Advanced Medical](../certifications/Advanced_Medical.md)
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md) along with a
[Medical Applicator](../weapons/Medical_Applicator.md). Reviving someone takes
25 units of ammo from a [Health Canister](../items/Health_Canister.md) and takes
several seconds. During this period, the Medic is vulnerable to attack, so other
players should attempt to cover a medic who is trying to revive someone.

When trying to revive a player, the Advanced Medic needs to be close enough so
that the "Corpse of" dialogue comes up underneath the reticle. Also, when
pointing the Medical Applicator at the ground, the "Corpse of" dialogue needs to
show up to be able to revive the player. Generally, the area around the feet is
the easiest area to find the "Corpse of" dialogue.
