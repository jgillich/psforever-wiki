# Platoon

A platoon is a large group of soldiers with multiple [squads](Squad.md). A
platoon:

- Does not share [experience points](Experience_Points.md) with other members
  unless they are in the same [squad](Squad.md).
- Creates a platoon chat group that is used to alert members of threats, needs,
  and orders.
- Allows the members of the platoon to see the waypoints of all the
  [squads](Squad.md) in the platoons created by [Squad Leaders](Squad_Leader.md)
  and the [Platoon Leader](Platoon_Leader.md) assuming the
  [Squad Leader](Squad_Leader.md) and [Platoon Leader](Platoon_Leader.md) are
  atleast [Command Rank](Command_Rank.md) 1.
- Allows the [Platoon Leader](Platoon_Leader.md) to create battle plans on the
  [Continental Map](Continental_Map.md) for the entire platoon. (Requires
  [Command Rank](Command_Rank.md) 3 or above)
