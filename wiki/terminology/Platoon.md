A platoon is a large group of soldiers with multiple
[squads](Squad.md). A platoon:

- Does not share [experience points](Experience_Points.md)
  with other members unless they are in the same
  [squad](Squad.md).
- Creates a platoon chat group that is used to alert members of
  threats, needs, and orders.
- Allows the members of the platoon to see the waypoints of all the
  [squads](Squad.md) in the platoons created by [Squad
  Leaders](Squad_Leader.md) and the [Platoon
  Leader](Platoon_Leader.md) assuming the [Squad
  Leader](Squad_Leader.md) and [Platoon
  Leader](Platoon_Leader.md) are atleast [Command
  Rank](Command_Rank.md) 1.
- Allows the [Platoon Leader](Platoon_Leader.md) to create
  battle plans on the [Continental Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md)
  for the entire platoon. (Requires [Command
  Rank](Command_Rank.md) 3 or above)
