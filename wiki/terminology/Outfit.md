A player created and organized group of at least 2 players within the same
[Empire](Empire.md). Often times Outfits are specialized in one area. (i.e.
Aerial Combat, Sabotage, etc.) Outfits have the ability to earn
[Outfit Points](Outfit_Points.md). Once an Outfit has attained 10.000 Outfit
Points it may attain an Outfit Decal for use on
