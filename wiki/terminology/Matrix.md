Binding stores a player's DNA data into the [respawn tubes](../items/Respawn_Tube.md) of
the selected [facility](../locations/Facilities.md) or
[AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md).

To bind to a location, you must access a
[Matrix Panel](../items/Matrix_Panel.md) and press the "G" key when prompted.

This creates a [spawn point](Spawn_point.md) for the player to respawn to from
any location in the galaxy. Manually bound spawn points are available in
addition to the normal 'nearest' spawn points. A player may bind to one
[facility](../locations/Facilities.md) and one
[AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) at a time, meaning that if a
player plans his spawn points correctly, he or she can have up to 6 spawn points
to chose from (2 [AMSes](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md), 2
[bases](../locations/Facilities.md), a [tower](../locations/Towers.md), and the
[sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md)).

Pressing the "G" key again at the Matrix Panel of a bound location will erase
the DNA data and the bind.
