Animation culling is the process of cutting certain frames of animation (such as
a soldier running or the wheels on a [vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md)) to help
improve frame rates on less powerful machines.

The settings for this feature can be found in game under the "Advanced" tab
under "Video" options.
