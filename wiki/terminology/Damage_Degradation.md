[Damage Degradation](Damage_Degradation.md) refers to the loss of power of some
weapons at increasing distance. For these weapons, your shots will do less
damage to the target as the distance increases, thus to maximize your damage,
get as close as possible with these weapons. Most weapons don't start to have
Damage Degradation until a certain distance while others start to drop off in
damage almost immediately.

The [Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md) has _inverse_ Damage Degradation. It does more
damage at large distances and less damage at close distances.

Some weapons do not suffer Damage Degradation. Shotgun-type weapons do not have
Damage Degradation, yet their large [Cone of Fire](Cone_of_fire.md) means that
you are unlikely to land any hits at large distances anyway. Many
[vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) and beam-type weapons do not have Damage
Degradation either.

The following suffer from Damage Degradation:

- All [Standard Assault](../certifications/Standard_Assault.md) weaponry (except
  the [Mag-Scatter](../weapons/Mag-Scatter.md))
- All [Medium Assault](../certifications/Medium_Assault.md) weaponry (except the
  [Spiker](../weapons/Spiker.md) and [Sweeper](../weapons/Sweeper.md))
- [Lasher](../weapons/Lasher.md)
- [Mini-Chaingun](../weapons/Mini-Chaingun.md)
- [Orion](../weapons/Orion.md)
- [Avenger](../weapons/Avenger.md)
- All 12mm, 15mm, 20mm, 25mm, and 35mm [vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) weapons
- [Continuous Laser](../weapons/Continuous_Laser.md)
- [Anti-Tank Machine Gun](../weapons/Anti-Tank_Machine_Gun.md)
- [Rotary Chaingun](../items/Rotary_Chaingun.md)
- [Quasar](../armor/Quasar.md)
- [Dual Cycler](../armor/Dual-Cycler.md)
- [Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md) (inverse Damage Degradation, see above)
- [Wall Turret](../items/Phalanx.md) (standard fire mode)
- [Spitfire](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#spitfire-turret) and
  [Shadow Turrets](../weapons/Shadow_Turret.md)
