**Ping** is a term for "latency" or "lag". It indicates the amount of delay in
the network between your computer and the server in question.

In [PlanetSide](../PlanetSide.md), you can monitor your ping by executing
the command "/stats". The numbers shown represent the number of milliseconds
(thousandths of a second) that it takes for your game client to receive an
answer to a request.
