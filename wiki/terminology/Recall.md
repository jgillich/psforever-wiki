This option allows a player to [deconstruct](Deconstruct.md) and
[respawn](Respawn.md) back in the [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md). This
method is usually used for regrouping, re-equipping, or to travel to another
[continent](../locations/Continent.md) when access from the previous location is
not possible.

The location of the player affects the
[Recall timer](../ammunition/Recall_timer.md).

- Friendly [SOI](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md): 10 seconds
- Neutral SOI or open country: 20 seconds
- Enemy SOI: 30 seconds

A player can initiate a Recall by typing /recall or by selecting that option in
their Esc [Menu](../etc/Menu.md).
