A Virus is a corrupted data stream injected into base objects and deployables by
the [T-REK](../weapons/T-REK.md). A Virus can be removed from an object by an
[expert hacker](../certifications/Expert_Hacking.md) using a
[REK](../weapons/Remote_Electronics_Kit.md).

The [T-REK](../weapons/T-REK.md) may be used to infect
[facility](../locations/Facilities.md) systems by uploading a virus into the
[Main Terminal](../items/Main_Terminal.md). The possible viruses for the Main
Terminal and duration are listed below.

- Unlock all base doors - **60 minutes**
- Disable enemy radar - **15 minutes**
  - Removes all radar abilities for friendlies that are in the
    [SOI](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md) of the infected facility
- Disable linked benefits - **15 minutes**
  - All [module](../modules/index.md) benefits are disabled
  - [Continent](../locations/Continent.md)/[Cavern](../locations/Caverns.md)
    lock benefits will **not** be disabled
  - Will **not** effect other linked bases
- Access all enemy [equipment terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md) - **2
  minutes**
- Double [NTU](../items/NTU.md) resource drain - **60 minutes**
  - NTU will deplete at twice the normal rate

Viruses in the Main Terminal can be switched every 2 minutes or removed by an
expert hacker at any time. The enemy will be informed of the virus 30 seconds
after it is uploaded, and will cause the facility lights to flash green. The
virus information will also be available by double clicking on the facility on
the [Continental Map](Continental_Map.md), where it will show the type of
virus installed if your empire installed it, or "infected" otherwise. Viruses
cannot be installed into a base that is not powered. If the
[generator](../items/Generator.md) is destroyed at a base with an active virus,
the virus is temporarily disabled. Viruses cannot be removed from neutral bases
(except by [Black Ops](../factions/Black_Ops.md)).

Viruses can also be uploaded into enemy equipment, turning it against their
former owners for up to 15 minutes. The following equipment can be infected so
that it will hinder the enemy instead of helping them:

- Enemy
  [Spitfire Turrets](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#spitfire-turret)
  and [Wall Turrets](../items/Phalanx.md) can be infected, causing them to
  attack their own Empire
- Enemy [Aegis Shield Generators](../weapons/Aegis_Shield_Generator.md) can be
  infected so that they emit a [Pain Field](Pain_Field.md)
- Enemy
  [Motion Sensors](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#motion-sensor-alarm)
  can be infected causing them to display friendly units as enemies on radar.
