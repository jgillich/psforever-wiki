A Continental lock is when you own ALL the
[facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) on the
[continent](../locations/Continent.md). When you first get a lock, all
[towers](../locations/Towers.md) will revert to that Empire's control.

A continental lock prevents enemy troops from using the
[HART](HART.md) drop pods to reach that planet, forcing them to
use [warpgates](../locations/Warpgate.md). In addition, friendly troops may use
the [/broadcast channel](../chat/In-Game_Commands.md) to talk to any
friendly on the continent.

A lock will also provide [Empire Benefits](Empire_Benefit.md),
depending on the continent.

Also refered to as a Continent Lock, or
[Cont lock](Acronyms_and_Slang.md).
