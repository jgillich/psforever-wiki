"**Hack-and-Hold**" refers to [facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) that, in
order to be captured, must be [hacked](Hack.md) and the owning
[Empire](Empire.md) prevented from re-hacking (resecuring) the facility for 15
minutes. [Cavern](../locations/Caverns.md) facilities are also "hack-and-hold",
but they need only be protected for 10 minutes.

This was the original way to capture a facility, but with the introduction of
[LLU](Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) facilities, this term was coined in order to
distinguish between them. On the map screen, "hack-and-hold" facilities are
distinguished by having an icon of a clock on either side of the facility's
name.
