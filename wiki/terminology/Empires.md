Each character in [PlanetSide](../etc/PlanetSide.md) is a member of one of three
[Empires](Empires.md) (teams):

- [New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md)
- [Terran Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md)
- [Vanu Sovereignty](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md)

Each [Empire](Empires.md) is different in its philosophy, which carries into the
Empire-Specific weapons and vehicles.

Once a character has selected an [Empire](Empires.md) that character cannot
change Empires.
