Within the context of [PlanetSide](../etc/PlanetSide.md), **infantry**
refers to any soldiers (characters) that are not in a vehicle and not
using [MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) armor. Generally,
"[infiltrators](../items/Infiltration_Suit.md)" are distinguished from
other infantry as well, so essentially this term refers to soldiers
wearing:

- [Standard Exo-Suit](../armor/Standard_Exo-Suit.md) armor
- [Agile Exo-Suit](../armor/Agile_Exo-Suit.md) armor
- [Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) armor (Rexo)

Infantry troops are also colloquially referred to as "grunts" or
"softies".
