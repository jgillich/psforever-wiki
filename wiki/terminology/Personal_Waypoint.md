class="figure" } Players can set a single Personal Waypoint on the
[Continental Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md) to aid with navigation.

In map mode, <b>right-click</b> on the location to which you want the waypoint
to be set. A white triangular arrow icon will appear at that spot. On closing
the map, a white column of light will now be visible on the horizon, its base
located at the spot indicate on the map. If you use
[Instant Action](Instant_Action.md), your personal waypoint will be set close to
the [hotspot](Hotspot.md) you are meant to respond to.

To clear it, right click again on the triangle on the Continental Map. To set
another waypoint, right click at a new location. While only one Personal
Waypoint may exist at a time, it may be reused as often as you like.

Only you can see this white column. For squad co-ordination, Squad
[Waypoints](Waypoint.md), or a [Laze Pointer](../weapons/Laze_Pointer.md) must
be used.

(Note: Some players, particularly [Bolt Driver](../weapons/Bolt_Driver.md)
users, can find these columns extremely distracting. For best results, place the
waypoint a little 'behind' the target area, to prevent it blocking line of
sight.)
