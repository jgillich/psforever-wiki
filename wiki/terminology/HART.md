![Image:HART-Icon.jpg](HART-Icon.jpg "fig:Image:HART-Icon.jpg") The
**HART**, or **High Altitude Rapid Transport** shuttle, is a large
passenger spacecraft that makes regular flights at three minute
intervals to any of the ten [planets](../locations/Planet.md) and their
[continents](../locations/Continent.md). Landing and departing from special
platform hangars ([HART buildings](locations/HART_building.md)) in each
[Empire](Empire.md)'s [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md).

Boarding a HART will present you with a [Interstellar
Map](Interstellar_Map.md) where you can select your launch
destination; you will then descend via [Drop Pod](../items/Drop_Pod.md)
to the target you selected.

If you opt to drop into a [Poplocked](Population_Lock.md
[planet](../locations/Planet.md), you will be entered in a
[queue](Warp_queue.md), and you will automatically drop when a
position becomes open.

To disembark a HART before it departs, press the use key (default G),
you will appear outside of the HART doors in your
[sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md). You can "bail" (default key: alt+G)
from the HART once the vehicle clears the hangar, skipping the rest of
the launch animation, and enabling you to select a drop location faster.
