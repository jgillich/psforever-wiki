**Experience Points**, referred to as XP in game slang, are units earned through
the exploration of in-game items, destruction of enemy units and capture of
enemy [facilities](../locations/Facilities.md). Currently, there are three types
of experience: [Battle Experience](Battle_Experience_Points.md), or BEP,
[Command Experience](Command_Experience_Points.md), or CEP, and
[Support Experience](Support_Experience_Points.md) or SEP.
