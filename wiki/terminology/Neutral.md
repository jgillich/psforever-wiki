A [base](../locations/Facilities.md) will go **neutral** when the power level
([NTU](../items/NTU.md)) is completely depleted. Any neutral base can be hacked
by any empire (except for Capitol facilities, which still require two
sub-capitols to capture). However, a base cannot be completely captured until
power is restored. If a base is hacked, and the timer runs out (or
[LLU](Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) is delivered) before power is rechaged, the hack
will be lost, requiring rehacking and waiting another 15 minutes (or delivering
LLU again).

[NTUs](../items/NTU.md) are drained by autorepair of destroyed equipment. See
[Structure Armor](Structure_Armor.md) for a list of destroyable equipment and
the time they take to autorepair. Spawning, creating vehicles, and obtaining
equipment at a base does **not** accelerate the drain. Bases do not lose any
energy if the base is completely repaired. A [Virus](Virus.md) may be installed
by enemies into the [Main Terminal](../items/Main_Terminal.md) doubling the NTU
drain rate. [Capitols](../locations/Capitol.md) that have their
[Force Dome](../items/Force_Dome.md) active do not consume NTU for autorepair,
and thus cannot turn neutral.

Any [Modules](../etc/Modules.md) installed at the facility when it goes neutral
are destroyed.

Occasionally a special in-game event will cause a base to go **neutral** without
the base being drained first. [Black Ops](Black_Ops.md) can also hack a facility
to turn it neutral.
