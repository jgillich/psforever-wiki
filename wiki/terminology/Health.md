# Health

**Health**, is a measure of a soldier's physical condition. Health is shown as a
red guage in the [Bio pane](Heads-up_Display.md#Bio_Pane). If you have no
armor, all damage taken will come from your health, but with armor only a
fraction of the damage will come from your health. [Pain Fields](Pain_Field.md),
the [Radiator](../weapons/Radiator.md), and the
[Damage Crystal](../items/Damage_Crystal.md) bypass your armor and affect your
health directly.

Health can be recovered by using a [MedKit](../items/MedKit.md),
[Super Medkit](../items/Super_Medkit.md),
[Medical Applicator](../weapons/Medical_Applicator.md),
[Regeneration](../implants/Regeneration.md) or
[Second Wind](../implants/Second_Wind.md) [Implants](../implants/index.md) or
standing near a [Health Crystal](../items/Health_Crystal.md) or in a
[Medical Terminal](../items/Medical_Terminal.md).

The [Health Module](../modules/Health_Module.md) can also recover your health.
When you are within the [SOI](../locations/Sphere_of_Influence.md) of a base
with this benefit, you health will slowly regenerate. The
[Health Module](../modules/Health_Module.md) also raises your maximum health to
120/120.

The Health of friendly soldiers can be seen above their heads as a green bar, if
close enough, with black sections indicating damage. The Health of enemy
soldiers can be seen with the
[Enhanced Targeting](../implants/Enhanced_Targeting.md) Implant, as a red bar.
