**PlanetSide Reserves** was a program that ran from March 24, 2006 to March
27, 2007. It offered a limited version of [PlanetSide](../PlanetSide.md) without
a monthly fee. Characters were limited in [Battle Rank](Battle_Rank.md) and
[Command Rank](Command_Rank.md), and the program was set to end March 24, 2007.
When that date arrived, Reserves players were still able to log in and play, and
new Reserves accounts could still be created, but on March 27, the program was
ended.

In conjunction with the launch of the PlanetSide Reserves, all paying accounts
received access to [AfterShock](../items/AfterShock.md) content.
