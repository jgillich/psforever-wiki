**Empire** refers to the 3 factions that are at war for control of
[Auraxis](../locations/Auraxis.md).

The three Empires are:

- The [Terran Republic](../etc/Terran_Republic.md)
- The [Vanu Sovereignty](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md)
- The [New Conglomerate](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md)

Every player is allowed to choose their Empire when creating a new
character. They are free to pick based upon any criteria they see fit,
including backstory, colors, weapons, population, or even random choice.

Current rules allow a player to have characters from any of the three
Empires. A player can only swap between these three empires once every
12 hours.

[Black Ops](Black_Ops.md) are sometimes considered a 4th empire,
as they can hack bases and are enemies of the other 3 empires. However,
Black Ops still carry many of the characteristics of the empire that
they left, and are not technically an empire.
