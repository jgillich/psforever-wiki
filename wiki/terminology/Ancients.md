The **Ancients** are alien beings, originally referred to as the Vanu, believed
to be the creators of the [Auraxis](../locations/Auraxis.md) construct, the
[Auraxian Core](../items/Auraxian_Core.md), the
[warpgates](../locations/Warpgate.md) and [lattice](Lattice.md), the
[rebirth](Respawn.md) and [nanite](../items/NTU.md) technology, and the
_Wormhole_ that brought us here.

Upon discovering the [caverns](../locations/Caverns.md) of Auraxis, we got a
glimpse of where the Ancients must have lived or worked. They left behind
artifacts and residual energy signatures for
[Ancient Technology](Ancient_Technology.md)  that we have been able to adapt to
our own needs.

The appearance, motives, and whereabouts of the Ancients are a complete mystery.
As revealed by [The Bending](../etc/The_Bending.md) it is thought that the
Ancients were masters of manipulating space-time, able to move or alter
different dimensions and realities through complex technology. It is this
technology that has allowed us to cheat death in our wars. Sadly, this
immortality is not without a price. We have become slaves to the Ancients'
creations, bound to each [planet](../locations/Planet.md) and cavern by the fear
of final death.

The Ancients are the most powerful beings in the known universe. We must harness
their power if we are return to Earth and defend all humanity against them or
their enemies. This is our purpose and our curse and we cannot fail.
