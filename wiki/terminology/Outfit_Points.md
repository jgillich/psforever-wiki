Outfit Points are contributed to Players that are in an [Outfit](Outfit.md).

For every 100
[BEP](Battle_Experience_Points.md)/[SEP](Support_Experience_Points.md) and every
50 [Command Experience Points](Command_Experience_Points.md) gained, the Player
is awarded 1 Outfit Point.

When an Outfit reaches 10.000 Outfit Points, it can select an
[Outfit Decal](Outfit_Decal.md).

Outfit Points don't do anything for the Player, except show how much he has
contributed to the [Outfit](Outfit.md).

Outfit Points are lost when leaving the Outfit.
