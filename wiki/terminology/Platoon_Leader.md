The [Platoon Leader](Platoon_Leader.md) is the [Squad
Leader](Squad_Leader.md) who invited the other two Squad Leaders
to merge their [squads](Squad.md) with his to form a
[Platoon](Platoon.md). Typically, in a default interface, the
[Platoon Leaders](Platoon_Leader.md) squad will be the first
uppermost squad, followed by the first invited squad (or first to accept
the invite) in the middle and most recently joined at the bottom.
