# Reticle

A Reticle is a two-dimensional weapon trajectory reference.

Usually in the form of trunkated crosshairs, it shows the center of the cone of
fire and a realtime indicator of accuracy.

In some situations, other information may be added, such as an altitude tape or
vehicle heading indicator.
