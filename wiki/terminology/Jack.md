The process of stealing an enemy vehicle using a
[Remote Electronics Kit](../weapons/Remote_Electronics_Kit.md) (REK) and
[Advanced Hacking](../certifications/Advanced_Hacking.md)
[certification](../certifications/Certification.md).

To Jack a [vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md), approach it and use the REK
anywhere on its surface so that the word "Jack" appears in the middle of your
screen. A timer will appear, similar to other hacking tasks, after which the
vehicle will change ownership to the hacker, and its color scheme will change to
show its new [Empire](Empire.md). Cloaked [Phantasms](../vehicles/Phantasm.md)
and [Wraiths](../vehicles/Wraith.md) can be jacked, but requires the hacker to
use the [Darklight](../implants/Darklight.md) implant to begin the jacking
process.

Vehicles may be hacked if they belong to another empire.
[Advanced Hackers](../certifications/Advanced_Hacking.md) may only jack
unoccupied vehicles. [Expert Hackers](../certifications/Expert_Hacking.md) may
jack both occupied and unoccupied vehicles as long as they are stationary. All
vehicles are hackable, including Empire Specific enemy vehicles that would
otherwise be unavailable to the hacker through
[Vehicle Terminals](../locations/Vehicle_Terminal.md), and
[BattleFrame Robotics](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md), although the timer
there is long enough to make jacking a tricky process.
[One-Manned Field Turrets](../weapons/One-Manned_Field_Turret.md) can be jacked
with or without an occupant. Nobody may enter a vehicle in the process of being
jacked, and those who try will receive a text message warning that the vehicle
is being stolen.

The hacker will still need to be certified to drive the stolen vehicle if he is
to make a clean getaway with it, although may hop in the gunner seat immediately
and start causing havoc. The original owner of the vehicle is immediately
notified on his screen that his vehicle has been stolen, and the proximity map
icon will change from green to red for all to see, so getting the vehicle away
before it is destroyed takes some planning.

At present there is no way to store jacked vehicles in any sort of
[Lockers](../items/Lockers.md). Also, most empire specific vehicles use empire
specific ammuntion, which can only then be replaced by stealing another vehicle
with a full [Trunk](Trunk.md).

[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) Suits may not be jacked, and
you'd be amazed how badly they react when they get a REK in the faceplate...

(Note: Many strange screenshots and board signatures feature Red and Black
[Magriders](../vehicles/Magrider.md), Purple and Green
[Vanguards](../vehicles/Vanguard.md) and so on - this is how it's done.)
