**Friendly fire** is damage caused by members of the same [Empire](Empire.md) to
each other. As its name implies, this is primarily damage caused by
[weapons](../weapons/Weapon.md), but within the context of
[PlanetSide](../etc/PlanetSide.md) can also include damage from
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) as it relates to [Grief](Grief_points.md).

Unlike many "traditional" team-based first-person shooters, PlanetSide does not
make members of the same team (Empire) immune to each others weapons. It is
possible to damage and kill one's teammates. This is one of the features that
makes PlanetSide more tactical.
