Similar to [Empire Incentives](Empire_Incentives.md), Global incentives
adjust [experience point](Battle_Experience_Points.md) bonuses based upon
population disadvantages. The bonus percentage is the percent difference between
the highest [empire](Empire.md) population and yours. For example, if the global
populations are 40%, 35%, and 25% for the [TR](Terran_Republic.md),
[NC](New_Conglomerate.md), and [VS](Vanu_Sovereignty.md),
respectively, the TR would receive no bonus, the NC would receive a +5%
[BEP](Battle_Experience_Points.md) bonus, and the VS would receive a +15% bonus.
These apply to the entire empire across the server on any planet or continent.
Respawn and purchase bonuses are not awarded on a global scale, only by
[zone](Zone.md).

Since patch [3.15.18](../patches/3.15.18.md), Global Incentives are now
calculated every few minutes instead of taking the average population over the
last few days. The calculated bonuses are added to any zone bonus.
