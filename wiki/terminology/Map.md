There are several kinds of maps available in Planetside:

- [Interstellar Map](Interstellar_Map.md) - also called
  Galactic or Global Map.
- [Continental Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md) - also called
  continent, planetary, or overhead map; shows view of selected
  continent.
- Cluster View Map - shows view of a selected island in a cluster.
- Cavern Map - shows view of selected cavern.

These maps are sometimes collectively refered to as the Game Map or
Overhead Map.

There is also another map that appears on your [HUD](../etc/Heads-up_Display.md)
screen, but has different features. This is the [Proximity
Map](Proximity_Map.md), also called Proximity Radar or Radar
Map.
