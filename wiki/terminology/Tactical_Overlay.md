![](../images/Tactical-Overlay.jpg "fig:Tactical-Overlay.jpg") Battle represented on the
Tactical Overlay\]\] The Tactical Overlay is a grid of colored blocks on the
continent map that can be used to monitor friendly troop deployment, detect
enemy forces, and visualize the flow of battle.

All players have access to this tactical data, regardless of battle or command
rank.

To view the tactical data, click on the Tactical toggle on the continent map, or
press the A key.

Each square is 1/4 by area of the map's [Grid](Grid.md) squares.

## Interpreting

Aqua squares represent areas under surveillance, where no significant troop
activity is detected.

Purple, Red, and Blue squares indicate [VS](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md),
[TR](../etc/Terran_Republic.md), and [NC](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md) movements,
respectively.

Yellow areas indicate contested regions (i.e. nearly equal number of enemy and
friendly units, or nearly equal number of two different enemies).

Relative opacity increases as the total number of detected individuals
increases.

## Detection

Friendly troops are shown on the tactical overlay all all times. Enemy troops
are only shown if they are in the detection range (aqua squares). The detection
area is determined by two factors: Friendly units and towers. Friendly
[Scout Vehicles](../certifications/Light_Scout.md) have a large detection area
while foot soldiers have a slightly smaller detection range. Tower detection
area is determined by tower type and its location.
[Watch towers](../locations/Watch_tower.md) have a larger detection area than
[Gun towers](../locations/Gun_tower.md) or
[Air towers](../locations/Air_tower.md). Because of interference, towers close
to bases have smaller detection areas than those in the open
([Warpgate](../locations/Warpgate.md) outpost towers).

## Undetectable Units

Certain enemy units do not show up on the tactical overlay. These include:

- Cloaked Units (Cloaked Infiltrators, [Wraiths](../vehicles/Wraith.md), and
  [Phantasms](../vehicles/Phantasm.md))
- Support Vehicles ([AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md),
  [Router](../vehicles/Router.md), and [Lodestar](../vehicles/Lodestar.md))
- Special Operation Vehicles ([Galaxy](../vehicles/Galaxy.md),
  [Leviathan](../vehicles/Leviathan.md),
  [Juggernaut](../vehicles/Juggernaut.md), and
  [Vindicator](../vehicles/Vindicator.md))
- Gate Shielded (any unit inside a [Warpgate](../locations/Warpgate.md) or
  active [Geowarp](../locations/Geowarp.md) bubble)

Occupants of undetectable units are also undetectable (e.g. galaxy passengers)
