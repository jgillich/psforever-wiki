**Beta** is short for "Beta test", which is the common name for software testing
that has expanded beyond internal "alpha testing". It generally involves
recruiting outside people to use the software in order to improve the chances
that an error will be found before release and also to stress test the
application with a significantly higher number of users.

In terms of [PlanetSide](../etc/PlanetSide.md), it refers to the beta test
period in the approximately two months before the game was released in
May, 2003. Many veterans of the game will state that they have "played since
beta," indicating that they have been participating since before the official
release of the game. This period may also be further distinguished as consisting
of "closed beta", when only those invited could participate in the testing, and
"open beta", when anyone could sign up to test.
