**Waypoints** are markers placed on the
[Continental Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md), and show up in the
[HUD](../etc/Heads-up_Display.md) as pillars of light with animated arrowheads
at the base.

There are many different waypoints in [PlanetSide](../etc/PlanetSide.md):

- **Squad/Platoon Waypoints**: These waypoints are placed by Squad leaders that
  are [Command Rank](Command_Rank.md) 1 or higher. These are visible to all
  members of the [squad](Squad.md) the CR1 is leading, and are shared between
  squads in a [platoon](Platoon.md). These waypoints are colored according to
  the position of the [Squad Leader](Squad_Leader.md) setting them within a
  platoon, i.e., waypoints set by a particular squad leader will match the color
  of that squad's names in the
  [Squad Bar](../etc/Heads-up_Display.md#Squad_Bar).

<!-- -->

- **Squad Experience Waypoint**: This waypoint is represented by a blue diamond.
  The closer you are to this waypoint, the more
  [Battle Experience Points](Battle_Experience_Points.md) you get when another
  member of your squad scores a kill in the same zone. The squad leader can keep
  the location of this as the centroid of the squad (default) or change it to
  follow a specific squad member (done in the "manage" tab) if he is
  [Command Rank](Command_Rank.md) 3 or higher.

<!-- -->

- **Squad Home Base Waypoint**: A [Squad Home Base](Squad_Home_Base.md) (if one
  is set) is marked by a green triangle on the
  [Continental Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md) as a waypoint.

<!-- -->

- **LLU Waypoint**: If a player has an [LLU](Lattice_Logic_Unit.md) in their
  inventory a purple triangular waypoint will appear indicating the destination
  the LLU must be taken to.

<!-- -->

- **Personal Waypoint**: Players can set a single
  [Personal Waypoint](Personal_Waypoint.md), colored white and visible only to
  themselves, to aid navigation within a [zone](Zone.md).

<!-- -->

- **Laze Pointer Waypoint**: With the
  [Laze Pointer](../weapons/Laze_Pointer.md), any soldier can set a temporary
  waypoint for use as a target for a [Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md) or a
  [Liberator](../vehicles/Liberator.md) bombing run. This will be color-coded
  and marked with the squad member's number.

There are also 3 special waypoints that have unique differences from the ones
listed above:

- **Orbital Strike Waypoint**: If a friendly [CR4](Command_Rank.md) or
  [CR5](Command_Rank.md) player has placed an
  [Orbital Strike](../commands/Orbital_Strike.md) waypoint on the map, it is
  visible as a colored beam of light in the gameworld: blue for
  [NC](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md), red for [TR](../etc/Terran_Republic.md), and
  purple for [VS](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md). The waypoint is not visible on
  the [Proximity Map](Proximity_Map.md) or the
  [Continental Map](../etc/Continental_Map.md).

<!-- -->

- **Rabbit Waypoint**: If there is a [Rabbit](Rabbit.md)
  [event](../etc/Events.md) on the zone you are on, an orange circular waypoint
  will appear on your proximity and continental maps. This waypoint is not
  visible in the gameworld as the other waypoints are. The waypoint will point
  in the direction of the rabbit ball.

<!-- -->

- **Vehicle Waypoint**: If you own a [vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md), but are
  not currently operating it, a yellow rectangle will appear on the proximity
  map pointing in the direction of your vehicle if it is not within the range of
  the proximity map's current zoom setting.
