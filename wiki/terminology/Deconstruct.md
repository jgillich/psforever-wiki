**Deconstructing** refers to one of two things:

1. When a player [Recalls](Recall.md), calls
   [Instant Action](Instant_Action.md), enters a
   [Respawn tube](../items/Respawn_Tube.md), or accesses an
   [AMS's](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md)
   [Respawn panel](Respawn_panel.md) and dematerializes in a cloud of green
   nanite dust.
   - To deconstruct, simply approach one of the above areas and press the "G"
     key when prompted to deconstruct.
2. When a game object dematerializes in a cloud of green nanite dust. The
   occasions for this to happen vary.
   - Destroyed vehicles dematerializing after a time to clear roadways and lines
     of fire.
   - Auto-deconstruction of a vehicle too close to an exterior doorway,
     restricted ground, [vehicle pad](../locations/Vehicle_Terminal.md), or
     [zipline](../items/Zipline.md).
   - Auto-deconstruction of a vehicle that has lost ownership. This occurs five
     minutes after ownership is lost
     ([AMSes](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) have a 15 minute timer)
   - Dematerializing of objects, such as [backpacks](Backpack.md), in areas of
     heavy population or activity to reduce lag.
   - Manual deconstruction of a vehicle by the player from their
     [vehicle](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) management window.
