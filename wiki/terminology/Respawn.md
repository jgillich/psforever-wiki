Respawning occurs after one has voluntarily [deconstructed](Deconstruct.md), or
died and "released" their corpse. A player will then reappear in a
[Respawn tube](../items/Respawn_Tube.md) or
[AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) cloak bubble, wearing a
[Standard Exo-Suit](../armor/Standard_Exo-Suit.md) and minimal weapons and ammo.

A [Respawn timer](terminology/Respawn_timer.md) governs how quickly a player
transitions from death to respawning. The timer increases with each death, but
can be reduced by staying alive longer or with the
[Bio Laboratory](../locations/Bio_Laboratory.md) or
[Speed Module](../etc/Speed_Module.md) benefits.

Respawning is sometimes refered to simply as Spawning.

A player typically has 4 spawn points: the closest friendly-controlled
[base](../locations/Facilities.md), [tower](Tower.md), and
[AMS](../vehicles/Advanced_Mobile_Station.md), if they exist, in addition to the
[Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md), which is always available. If the player
has [bound](Bind.md) to an AMS and/or base, or has an active
[Squad Home Base](Squad_Home_Base.md), he/she may respawn there as well even if
they are not the closest base/AMS. In the [Caverns](../locations/Caverns.md),
the closest [Module Building](../locations/Module_Building.md) and
[Redoubt Building](../locations/Redoubt_Building.md) are available to spawn
from, if your empire controls them.
