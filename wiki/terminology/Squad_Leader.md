The [Squad Leader](Squad_Leader.md) is the current leader of a
[squad](Squad.md).

When the leader has higher [Command Ranks](Command_Rank.md) they are able to
help the squad accomplish its goal faster and better through the use of extra
command abilities, such as Reveal Enemies, Squad Waypoints, and more.

The [Squad Leader](Squad_Leader.md) always has the number 1 within a
[squad](Squad.md) and is the only [squad](Squad.md) member capable of initiating
or accepting [platoon](Platoon.md) invites.

The Squad Leader gains [Battle Experience Points](Battle_Experience_Points.md)
for kills as any other member of the squad, but gains
[Command Experience Points](Command_Experience_Points.md) instead of Battle
Experience during [facility](../locations/Facilities.md) captures. Only the squad leader gains
CEP in this way; all other squad members gain BEP during captures, as normal.

The Squad Leader also has access to list the squad in the players menu with a
custom title, set requirements for each squad position, and view the
[certifications](../certifications/Certifications.md) of each member of the
squad. They are also the only member of the squad allowed to access the
[Main Console](../items/Main_Terminal.md) at bases.
