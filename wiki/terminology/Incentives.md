**Incentives** are bonuses awarded to an underpopulated empire and include a
percentage increase in [Experience Points](Experience_Points.md) awarded for
kills and reduction in spawn timers and vehicle acquisition timers.

Incentives are applied in two different scales:

- [Empire Incentives](../etc/Empire_Incentives.md) (Planetary (Continent/Cavern)
  scale)
- [Global Incentives](Global_Incentives.md) (Universal scale)
