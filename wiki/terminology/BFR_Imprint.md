**BFR Imprinting** is the process by which a soldier acquires
[BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) certification.

The imprint is used to tune the [Resonance
Crystals](Resonance_Crystals.md) implanted in all soldier to the
thought-patterns of that particular soldier so as to allow the soldier
to control the systems of a BFR.

The process includes achieving 5 [Cavern
Captures](../etc/Cavern_Captures.md) and getting 75 [unique
kills](Unique_kill.md) inside the caverns. Kills on enemies in
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) or [Ancient Sentry
Turrets](../items/Ancient_Sentry_Turret.md) do not count toward the kill
requirement. After the capture and kill requirements, you must step into
the core beam at the [Core Complex](../locations/Core_Complex.md) in one of
the caves to complete the imprinting process. Characters created before
June 18, 2009 are automatically imprinted and do not have to go through
this process (see: [6th Anniversary
Update](../patches/6th_Anniversary_Update.md)).
