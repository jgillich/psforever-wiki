**Wraith**

The **Wraith** is an all terrain vehicle (ATV). It is not mounted with
any weapons systems at all, but is mounted with an infiltration-based
cloaking ability. While the rider is wearing the [Infiltration
Suit](Infiltration_Suit.md "wikilink"), the whole vehicle can be made
invisible. This follows the same rules as the infiltration suit: the
faster it moves the more visible it becomes. The ATV has a cruise speed
over flat ground of 88kph and can reach uncontrollable speeds of 212kph.

The trunk is equal in capacity to the other wheeled
[ATVs](ATV.md "wikilink"), but without weapons, the space is unallocated,
thus available for the users' discretionary use. The Wraith remains
cloaked when parked, further aiding its usefulness as an extended
personal [Inventory](Inventory.md "wikilink").

The other Quad ATV variants are the [Fury](Fury.md "wikilink") and the
[Basilisk](Basilisk.md "wikilink").
