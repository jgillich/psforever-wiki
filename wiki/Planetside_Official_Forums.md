Also known as "[ForumSide](Forumside.md)"

The [PlanetSide Official
Forums](http://forums.station.sony.com/ps/forums/list.m) are a set of
forum boards hosted by [SOE](SOE.md). It is the official place
on the internet to discuss matters concerning
[PlanetSide](PlanetSide.md), and is thuse the largest gathering
place for community minded players.

Currently, the forums are powered by [Lithium](http://lithium.com/)
forum software, but SOE is currently in the process of remaking the
forums with new software.

At the moment, there have been two versions of the forum. Originally,
there was a fairly basic BBcode board, and now there is the Lithium
board.
