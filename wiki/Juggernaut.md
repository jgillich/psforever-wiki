**Juggernaut**

The _Juggernaut_ is the Terran Republic's heavy troop transport vehicle.
It features 2 75mm and 2 15mm Chainguns on the top and 2
[Ballguns](Ballgun.md) on the side. The Juggernaut can pass
through enemy [Shield Module](Shield_Module.md) defenses.

The 15mm Chainguns are nearly identical to those found on the
[Raider](Raider.md) and [Prowler](Prowler.md). These are
best used to combat enemy aircraft and vehicles, not infantry.

The driver can wear up to [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) armor. The driver also has
access to an [EMP](EMP.md) blast (default key: "b"). The
capacitor must recharge before it can be fired again. The capacitor
status is shown on the [HUD](Heads-up_Display.md) bar. The driver can also
activate the vehicle horn (default key: "f").

The side [Ballguns](Ballgun.md) have a limited view, but if the
user has the [Darklight](Darklight.md)
[Implant](Implants.md), he/she can see
[cloaked](Infiltration_Suit.md) enemies at a longer range than
normal, providing excellent side defense.

Originally, the name "Juggernaut" was given to the Terran Republic's
gunner variant [BFR](BattleFrame_Robotics.md), which is now known as the
[Colossus](Colossus.md).
