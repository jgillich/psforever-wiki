The front door faces east, towards the Gun Tower. The nearby Southeast
[Courtyard](Courtyard.md "wikilink") gate features a single
[Pillbox](Pillbox.md "wikilink") facing South.

The terrain around Drakulu features dramatic elevations; to the North is
a steep cliff which provides a strategic vantage on the
[courtyard](courtyard.md "wikilink") for attackers. Significant hills
extend both West and East from the [SOI](SOI.md "wikilink"). To the South
is a moderately steep but not impassable descent to
[Rehua](Rehua.md "wikilink"). This sloping area is heavily featured with
small hills, valleys, boulders, and trees.
