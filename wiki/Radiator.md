**Radiator**

[image:Radiator-Icon.jpg](image:Radiator-Icon.md.jpg "wikilink")

The [Radiator](Radiator.md "wikilink") is an indirect damage weapon. The
projectiles themselves do no damage, but once they explode they
irradiate the immediate area causing damage to all soldiers within the
area. There is no protection from this damage, even in a vehicle, except
for leaving the irradiated area. However, the damage from the weapon is
cut in half if you are in a vehicle or in a [MAX](MAX.md "wikilink") suit.

In addition to the [Special Assault](Special_Assault.md "wikilink")
[Certification](certifications.md "wikilink"), unless the user is in the
core, the base must have an [Equipment
Module](Equipment_Module.md "wikilink") installed for the weapon to be
purchased.

In primary mode, the projectile will bounce off hard surfaces and will
explode when it comes to rest. In secondary mode, the projectile
"sticks" the the first surface it contacts.

When the shell explodes, the effect is radial and can go through any
nearby wall. Thus this is an excellent [Back Door](Back_Door.md "wikilink")
defense weapon, as it will hurt enemies before they even open the door.

While not damaging the shields or armor of [BFRs](BFR.md "wikilink"), the
radiator can still damage BFR systems such as sensor and aiming systems,
as well as reduce the health of the driver/gunner. Combined with a
[Jammer grenade](Jammer_grenade.md "wikilink") or [EMP](EMP.md "wikilink")
blast, the radiator can be used to either kill the ocupants of a
[BFR](BFR.md "wikilink") or make them eject, leaving you with an otherwise
undamaged [BFR](BFR.md "wikilink") that can be [hacked](hack.md "wikilink").

Note: [Radiator](Radiator.md "wikilink") effects do not "stack."
Overlapping irradiated areas always deal the same amount of damage over
time, they do not double or triple the damage.
