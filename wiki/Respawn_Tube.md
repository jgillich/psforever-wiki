![](images/PSScreenShot0289.jpg "fig:PSScreenShot0289.jpg") A **Respawn tube**,
also known as a Spawn Tube, is where a soldier appears after respawning
from death, after "[deconstructing](deconstruct.md)" at another
tube (see below), or using [Instant Action](Instant_Action.md)
or [Recall](Recall.md).

**Respawn tubes** are found in base [facilities](facilities.md)
and [towers](towers.md), as well as the [Spawn/VR
buildings](Respawn_Building.md) in
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary.md).
[AMSes](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md) do not have **respawn
tubes**, but spawn soldiers randomly within the cloak bubble. Cavern
[facilities](facilities.md) (See: [Core
Combat](Core_Combat.md)) do not have **respawn tubes** either,
but a respawn "area" in the center of the respawn room.

**Respawn tubes** can be destroyed, and the destruction of the tubes is
one of the most basic strategies in taking over a
[facility](facilities.md).

## Deconstructing

By entering a **respawn tube** a soldier can
"[deconstruct](deconstruct.md)" and respawn at another [spawn
point](spawn_point.md).
