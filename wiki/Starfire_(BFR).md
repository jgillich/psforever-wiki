**Starfire (BFR)**

The [BFR](/BFR "wikilink") Starfire anti aircraft weaponry is an
adaptation of the similarly named [VS](/VS "wikilink")
[MAX](/MAX "wikilink"). It features lock on systems that will guide in
flight projectiles to the currently painted target. Each energy sphere
has an outer plasmoid mass that continues to eat away at the target
after the initial explosive impact. It has no splash damage and does
significantly less damage than the [Starfire](/Starfire "wikilink")
[MAX](/MAX "wikilink"). It does a fair ammount of damage to ground
vehicles as well if you can hit them.
