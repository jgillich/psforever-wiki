The island rises from the sea as a pile of stacked mesas and crumbling
cliffs.

A path runs from each warp point to one of the three facilities on the
island, but there are also pedestrian switchback pathways up the sheer
Cliffside to allow quicker foot access to higher mesas.

The three facilities are neighbors to one another across the top of the
mesa (via a crossover plateau), so defense of those areas is critical
for control of this island.
