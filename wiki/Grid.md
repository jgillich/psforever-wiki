To aid navigation, each [Continental](Continent.md "wikilink") and
[Cavern](Cavern.md "wikilink") [map](Continental_Map.md "wikilink") is divided
into a **grid** of squares.

Each grid location is referenced by "letter-number", with letters
starting at _A_ and going from left to right, with numbers starting with
_1_ going from top to bottom. Therefore, the top left corner is _A1_.

The actual area of each square varies by map.

Additionally, the grid coordinates for the square you are currently in
is displayed in your [Proximity Map](Proximity_Map.md "wikilink"), and the
locations of [squad](squad.md "wikilink") and [platoon](platoon.md "wikilink")
members is displayed under their name on the [HUD](HUD.md "wikilink").
