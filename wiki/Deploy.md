Certain [vehicles](vehicle.md "wikilink") require that they be
"**deployed**" in order for their abilities to be used. "Deploying"
renders the vehicle immobile. "Undeploying" is simply the act of leaving
the "deployed" state in order to then drive the vehicle.

The following vehicles can be "deployed":

[Advanced Mobile Station](Advanced_Mobile_Station.md "wikilink") (AMS) : Deploying the AMS engages its cloak bubble and allows soldiers to [spawn](spawn.md "wikilink"), [deconstruct](deconstruct.md "wikilink"), use the [Equipment terminals](Equipment_terminal.md "wikilink") and bind. Undeploying reverses the procedure and allows the AMS to be driven again.
[Advanced Nanite Transport](Advanced_Nanite_Transport.md "wikilink") (ANT) : When deployed in a [Warpgate](Warpgate.md "wikilink") or [Geowarp](Geowarp.md "wikilink") bubble, the ANT gathers [NTUs](NTU.md "wikilink"). When deployed near an [NTU Silo](NTU_Silo.md "wikilink"), the NTUs are transfered to the silo, powering the [facility](facility.md "wikilink").
[Flail](Flail.md "wikilink") : Deploying the Flail allows its Dispersion Cannon to be used.
[Router](Router.md "wikilink") : Deploying the Router allows a [telepad](telepad.md "wikilink") to be deployed and allows the link to be established.
[Switchblade](Switchblade.md "wikilink") : While the Switchblade can fire while "undeployed", its rate-of-fire is greatly increased if it is deployed.

To deploy and undeploy, the default key is 'B'.

"Deploying" can also refer to the use of the
[ACE](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md "wikilink") by a [Combat
Engineer](Combat_Engineering.md "wikilink"). The items that can be created
from an ACE are often called "deployables."

The [Terran Republic](Terran_Republic.md "wikilink")
[MAX](MAX.md "wikilink")'s "[anchoring](anchoring.md "wikilink")" ability is
essentially the same as "deploying" it, but is never referred to in that
way. Similarly, [BFRs](BFR.md "wikilink") can crouch and improve fire rate,
accuracy, and shield recharge, similar to TR MAXes.
