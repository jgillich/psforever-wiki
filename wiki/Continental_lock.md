A Continental lock is when you own ALL the
[facilities](facilities.md "wikilink") on the
[continent](continent.md "wikilink"). When you first get a lock, all
[towers](towers.md "wikilink") will revert to that Empire's control.

A continental lock prevents enemy troops from using the
[HART](HART.md "wikilink") drop pods to reach that planet, forcing them to
use [warpgates](warpgate.md "wikilink"). In addition, friendly troops may
use the [/broadcast channel](In.$1.md "wikilink") to talk to any
friendly on the continent.

A lock will also provide [Empire Benefits](Empire_Benefit.md "wikilink"),
depending on the continent.

Also refered to as a Continent Lock, or [Cont
lock](Acronyms_and_Slang.md "wikilink").
