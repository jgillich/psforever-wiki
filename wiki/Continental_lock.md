A Continental lock is when you own ALL the
[facilities](Facilities.md) on the
[continent](Continent.md). When you first get a lock, all
[towers](Towers.md) will revert to that Empire's control.

A continental lock prevents enemy troops from using the
[HART](HART.md) drop pods to reach that planet, forcing them to
use [warpgates](Warpgate.md). In addition, friendly troops may
use the [/broadcast channel](In-Game_Commands.md) to talk to any
friendly on the continent.

A lock will also provide [Empire Benefits](Empire_Benefit.md),
depending on the continent.

Also refered to as a Continent Lock, or [Cont
lock](Acronyms_and_Slang.md).
