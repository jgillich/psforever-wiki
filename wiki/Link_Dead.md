When a character is **Link Dead** (sometimes **linkdead**), it means
that the player's client has stopped communicating with the game server.
An "\[LD\]" will be shown under the character's name. If the connection
between the player's client and the server is not reestablished within a
few minutes, the character will be removed from the game world.
