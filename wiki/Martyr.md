**[martyr](User:Martyr "wikilink")'s Stragies and Tactics**

note: I lead the now-disbanded Strategic Air Command of my outfit, Sons
of Vanu. As we're now primarily a surface group, this is being made
avaliable. some of it is depricated, but enjoy.

**SOPs**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Mission*

To support and supplement Sons of Vanu operations via airborne infantry
& armor delivery, aggressive air superiority, and supressive
air-to-ground capabilities.

*Aircraft Aquisition*

During offensive operations, SAC pilots bind to the nearest cont-locked
friendly facility capable of generating approprate aircraft.

All aircraft have 5 minute spawn counters.

*Vehicle Storage Spaces*

All vehicles (space permitting) can carry non-vehicle ammunition and
other items/weapons placed in their trunks. If a favorite is created
with these items still in the trunk, they will be loaded with the
favorite.

*SAC reccomends:*

-   Favorites created for every AC cert held
-   REK
-   Repairgun, if not already in pilot's armor inventory \*
-   Sufficient nanite canisters to repair your aircraft at least once
    from a "control lost" state\*

<!-- -->

-   Regardless of pilot's engineering certification

*TeamSpeak*

All pilots should be in voice contact during SAC operations.

During multi-squad, practice, or testing operations, SAC pilots use
*Strategic Air Command* channel on the SoV TS server.

End each transmission with an identifier.\[quote="Example"\]Three commie

*Strategery*

There will be no Strategery. Thank you.

**POH**

*'Setup*

Fly with mouse & keyboard. There is little/no joystick support.

Check your keybinds, confirm locations of:

-   Vertical Thrusters: Up, Down (default "e" , "c")
-   Afterburner (default spacebar)
-   10% power increments (default numbers)
-   1% power increment keys (default "," , "." )

*Aircraft Loadouts*

When AC is generated, fly to nearest refit facility and load appropriate
favorite as defined in SOPs.

If avaliable, charge shields completely.

*Aircraft Repair & Rearm*

Rearm/Refit facilities include any facility linked to a dropship center
and any air tower.

To initiate reload: hover within 10m of aircraft pad. A prompt will
instruct "Press G to reload from this terminal."

Your aircraft will also be repaired whenever you're within reloading
radius regardless of relative position. Consider hovering underneath or
parallel to the Refit pad if it is crowded or the air is hot.

*Parking*

Don't park like an ass

Try to park with SAC

Four attack craft per pad

Always lock your canopy
