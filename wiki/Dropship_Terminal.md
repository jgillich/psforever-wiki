The **Dropship Terminal** is a special variant of the [Air
Terminal](/Air_Terminal "wikilink") large enough to allow the
construction of the [Galaxy](/Galaxy "wikilink") troop transport, the
[Galaxy Gunship](/Galaxy_Gunship "wikilink"), and
[Lodestar](/Lodestar "wikilink") vehicle transport air vehicles.

Other air vehicles ([Liberator](/Liberator "wikilink"),
[Mosquito](/Mosquito "wikilink"), [Reaver](/Reaver "wikilink"),
[Vulture](/Vulture "wikilink"), [Wasp](/Wasp "wikilink"),
[Phantasm](/Phantasm "wikilink")) may be obtained at this pad too, but
this type of pad is the only place the three largest aircraft can be
spawned.

This terminal will not create ground vehicles.

They can only be found at a [Dropship
Center](/Dropship_Center "wikilink"), or in
[Sanctuary](/Sanctuary "wikilink").
