**Wasp Chaingun Bullets**

These 12mm bullets are used only by the [Wasp](Wasp.md). They
are meant for anti-aircraft duty, but do decent damage to ground
[vehicles](vehicle.md) and [MAX](Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) units. The
bullets do minimal damage to [infantry](infantry.md), requiring
two clips to kill a soldier wearing [Reinforced
Exo-Suit](Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md) armor. The boxes can be
obtained from any [Equipment Terminal](Equipment_Terminal.md) to
be hand-loaded into the Wasp's [trunk](trunk.md) or acquired
while in the vehicle from a [Landing Pad](Landing_Pad.md).
