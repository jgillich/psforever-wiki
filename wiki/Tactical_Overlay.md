![](Tactical-Overlay.md.jpg "fig:Tactical-Overlay.jpg") Battle represented
on the Tactical Overlay\]\] The Tactical Overlay is a grid of colored
blocks on the continent map that can be used to monitor friendly troop
deployment, detect enemy forces, and visualize the flow of battle.

All players have access to this tactical data, regardless of battle or
command rank.

To view the tactical data, click on the Tactical toggle on the continent
map, or press the A key.

Each square is 1/4 by area of the map's [Grid](Grid.md "wikilink") squares.

## Interpreting

Aqua squares represent areas under surveillance, where no significant
troop activity is detected.

Purple, Red, and Blue squares indicate [VS](VS.md "wikilink"),
[TR](TR.md "wikilink"), and [NC](NC.md "wikilink") movements, respectively.

Yellow areas indicate contested regions (i.e. nearly equal number of
enemy and friendly units, or nearly equal number of two different
enemies).

Relative opacity increases as the total number of detected individuals
increases.

## Detection

Friendly troops are shown on the tactical overlay all all times. Enemy
troops are only shown if they are in the detection range (aqua squares).
The detection area is determined by two factors: Friendly units and
towers. Friendly [Scout Vehicles](Light_Scout.md "wikilink") have a large
detection area while foot soldiers have a slightly smaller detection
range. Tower detection area is determined by tower type and its
location. [Watch towers](Watch_tower.md "wikilink") have a larger detection
area than [Gun towers](Gun_tower.md "wikilink") or [Air
towers](Air_tower.md "wikilink"). Because of interference, towers close to
bases have smaller detection areas than those in the open
([Warpgate](Warpgate.md "wikilink") outpost towers).

## Undetectable Units

Certain enemy units do not show up on the tactical overlay. These
include:

- Cloaked Units (Cloaked Infiltrators, [Wraiths](Wraith.md "wikilink"),
  and [Phantasms](Phantasm.md "wikilink"))
- Support Vehicles ([AMS](AMS.md "wikilink"),
  [Router](Router.md "wikilink"), and [Lodestar](Lodestar.md "wikilink"))
- Special Operation Vehicles ([Galaxy](Galaxy.md "wikilink"),
  [Leviathan](Leviathan.md "wikilink"),
  [Juggernaut](Juggernaut.md "wikilink"), and
  [Vindicator](Vindicator.md "wikilink"))
- Gate Shielded (any unit inside a [Warpgate](Warpgate.md "wikilink") or
  active [Geowarp](Geowarp.md "wikilink") bubble)

Occupants of undetectable units are also undetectable (e.g. galaxy
passengers)
