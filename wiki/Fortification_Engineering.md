**Fortification Engineering**

The Fortification Engineering [certification](/certification "wikilink")
is one of the two latest additions to the Engineering tree, along with
it's offensive counterpart [Assault
Engineering](/Assault_Engineering "wikilink").

This certification is designed for defensive Engineering, and therefor
comes with Deployables that make it harder for Enemies to get inside
[Facilities](/Facility "wikilink") and [Towers](/Tower "wikilink"), as
well as Upgrading abilities for defensive structures like
[Phalanx](/Phalanx "wikilink") Wall Turrets.

## Field Deployment Unit (FDU)

This larger version of the [Adaptive Construction
Engine](/Adaptive_Construction_Engine "wikilink") (ACE) is used to create
the [TRAPs](/Tactical_Resonance_Area_Protection "wikilink"). It takes up
the same size as the biggest Rifles do in your
[inventory](/inventory "wikilink"). See [Field Deployment
Unit](/Field_Deployment_Unit "wikilink") for more information.

## Shadow Turret

This Turret is similar to the [Spitfire Turret](#Spitfire "wikilink"),
with the only difference being that it is invisible, and will only
become visible when firing. For more information see [Shadow
Turret](/Shadow_Turret "wikilink").

## Cerberus Turret

The Cerberus Turret is a modified Spitfire Turret, designed to attack
Aircraft by shooting [Flak](/Flak "wikilink"). It will not attack
Infantry unless fired upon, and doesn't do a lot of damage to them
either. For more information see [Cerberus
Turret](/Cerberus_Turret "wikilink").

## Tactical Resonance Area Protection (TRAP)

The TRAP is designed as a roadblock, to prevent
[vehicles](/vehicle "wikilink") from accessing a certain road. The can
take quite some damage before being destroyed, and do serious damage to
anything that tries to ram them. For more information see [Tactical
Resonance Area
Protection](/Tactical_Resonance_Area_Protection "wikilink").

## Phalanx Wall Turret Upgrades

The Fortification Engineering certification allows Engineers to upgrade
the [Phalanx](/Phalanx "wikilink") Wall Turrets at Facilities and Towers.
Using the newly designed [Upgrade Canister](/Upgrade_Canister "wikilink")
for the [Nano Dispenser](/Nano_Dispenser "wikilink") Wall Turrets can be
upgraded with either Anti-Aircraft weaponry or Anti-Vehicular weaponry,
besides their default firing method.

The Wall Turret must be unmanned, and almost at full health if you want
to upgrade the Turret. Upgrading a Turret takes a bit of time, so beware
of Enemy fire while upgrading. Once a Turret has been upgraded you can
change Weaponry again by repeating the process.

Upgrades will last for 30 minutes before reverting to a normal Wall
Turret, after it has reverted, it can of course be upgraded again.
Turrets will also lose their upgrade if the Facility or Towers get
captured by an opposing [Empire](/Empire "wikilink").

Auto-firing Turrets will only use the default firing method, so if you
want to use the Upgraded Weaponry, you will have to man the Turret
yourself.

## Aegis Shield Generator Upgrades

Once an [Assault Engineer](/Assault_Engineering "wikilink") has set up an
[Aegis Shield Generator](/Aegis_Shield_Generator "wikilink"),
Fortification Engineers will be able to upgrade it with certain
benefits.

The most important benefit is the ability to upgrade the cloaking field
with a Shield. To do this, simply "repair" the Aegis with a [Nano
Dispenser](/Nano_Dispenser "wikilink") equipped with a normal canister,
and it will start the upgrade process. The Shield Upgrade has priority
over all the other Upgrades that are possible. Once completed, the Aegis
will have a Shield protecting it, similar to that of a Facility that has
the [Shield Module](/Shield_Module "wikilink") benefit. Though any fire,
both Enemy and Friendly, directed at the Shield will reduce the Shields
power, though the fire will be blocked from passing through. Once the
Shield Generator reaches zero, it will overload, and explode. The Shield
can be recharged if it is below 100% the same way as upgrading the Aegis
works.

## Increased Combat Engineering Deployables

With the Fortification Engineering certification you will be able to
place additional numbers of [Combat
Engineering](/Combat_Engineering "wikilink") Deployables.

The Deployable numbers will be upgraded to:

- [Spitfire Turret](#Spitfire "wikilink") : From 10 to 15
- [Boomer](#Boomer "wikilink") : From 20 to 25
- [Motion Sensor](#Motion_Sensor "wikilink") : From 20 to 25
- [Heavy Explosive Mine](#HEMine "wikilink") : From 20 to 25

## Increased Repair Efficiency

Fortification Engineers use [Armor Canisters](/Armor_Canister "wikilink")
more efficiently, resulting in increased repair efficiency for
[MAXes](/MAX "wikilink") (1.5x, from 12 to 18), equipment, and
[vehicles](/vehicles "wikilink") (2x, from 32 to 64) over that of a
standard engineer.
