A **certification** (cert) is a soldier attribute that allows him or her to
operate specific classes equipment.

[Certifications](Certifications.md) are obtained at the expense of
[Certification points](Certification_points.md), which are earned through game
experience.

Some certifications have prerequisites that must be obtained in order.

Certs can be forgotten every 6 hours.

New Characters have a 7 day grace period, and don't have a penalty for
unlearning Certifications. After these 7 days, they will have to wait 6 hours to
unlearn Certifications again though.

You may only forget one certification at a time. However, if you forget a cert
that serves as a prerequisite for others, any dependant certifications will be
forgotten as well.

For example, if you have a [BFR](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md)
certification and you forget [Armored Assault I](Armored_Assault_I.md), you will
lose three certs: [Armored Assault I](Armored_Assault_I.md),
[Armored Assault II](Armored_Assault_II.md), and BFR. If you also had
[BFR Anti-Aircraft](BFR_Anti-Aircraft.md),
[BFR Anti-Infantry](BFR_Anti-Infantry.md), and [Flail](../items/Flail.md), you
will forget those as well.

With the release of version [3.11](../patches/3.11.md), characters will receive
the option to "forget all" certifications. This option is only usable once,
until the next major release, at which time each character will again receive
the option.

[Certification Terminals](../items/Certification_Terminal.md) can be found in
the [HART building](../locations/HART_building.md) of your
[Empire](../terminology/Empire.md)'s [Sanctuary](../locations/Sanctuary.md), and
in [Bio Laboratories](../locations/Bio_Laboratory.md).
