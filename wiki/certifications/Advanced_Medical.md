**Advanced Medical**

If one of your allies has been killed and has not yet clicked the "respawn"
button, their body will remain on ground (once they respawn their body becomes a
[backpack](../terminology/Backpack.md).) Simply point the
[Medical Applicator](../weapons/Medical_Applicator.md) at them and use it. You
will see a progress bar until they are revived. If the progress bar dissapears
during the process, **don't** let go, it is still reviving, this is merely a
bug.

Revived characters have full health, but zero
[Stamina](../terminology/Stamina.md) and deactivated
[Implants](../implants/index.md).

This [Certification](Certification.md) is required to obtain the
[Combat Resuscitation](../merits/Combat_Resuscitation.md),
[Resuscitation Medic](../merits/Resuscitation_Medic.md), and
[Universal Soldier](../merits/Universal_Soldier.md)
[Merit Commendations](../merits/index.md).
