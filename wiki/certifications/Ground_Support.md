**Ground Support**

The AMS is a vehicle crucial to ensuring the success of an attack. As such, each
empire will always want as many as possible certified in Ground Support.

Due to the Ancient-Tech nature of the router, it is possible to drive the Router
using a [Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md).

This [Certification](Certification.md) is required to obtain the
[AMS Support](../merits/AMS_Support.md),
[Router Support](../merits/Router_Support.md),
[Universal Soldier](../merits/Universal_Soldier.md) and
[Vehicle Support Specialist](../merits/Vehicle_Support_Specialist.md)
[Merit Commendations](../merits/index.md).
