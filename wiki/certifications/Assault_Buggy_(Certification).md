**Assault Buggy**

The [Skyguard](../vehicles/Skyguard.md) requires a
[Technology Plant](../locations/Technology_Plant.md) in order to be purchasable.

Due to the Open-Air Compartment, it is possible to drive all of these
[vehicles](../vehicles/index.md) while wearing
[Reinforced Exo-Suit](../armor/Reinforced_Exo-Suit.md). Additionally, the driver
of these vehicles may bail out at any time.
