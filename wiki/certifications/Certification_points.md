# Certification points

[Certification points](Certification_points.md) are what players use to acquire
[certifications](Certifications.md). [Certifications](Certifications.md) are
what gives players access to different weapons, armor, vehicles and abilities.

Starting characters ([Battle Rank](../terminology/Battle_Rank.md) 1) begin with
seven (7) [Certification points](Certification_points.md). As each
[Battle Rank](../terminology/Battle_Rank.md) is earned (with the exception of
Battle Rank 6, 12, 18, 24, 25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38), so is a new
Certification point, up to a maximum of 34 at Battle Rank 39. At Battle Rank 40,
all certifications will automatically become available to a player, removing the
use certification points.

If you choose to "forget" one of your [certifications](Certifications.md), the
certification points spent on it become immediately available to be spend on
other [certifications](Certifications.md). If you "forget" a certification that
is a prerequisite for another certification you have, both will be forgotten
automatically.

_Example: If you "forget" [Armored Assault I](Armored_Assault_I.md);
[Armored Assault II](Armored_Assault_II.md), [Flail](../vehicles/Flail.md),
[BattleFrame Robotics](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md),
[BFR Anti-Infantry](BFR_Anti-Infantry.md) and
[BFR Anti-Aircraft](BFR_Anti-Aircraft.md) will also be forgotten if you have
them certed._ Note, however, that you will not be able to "forget" another
certification for 6 hours.

Characters newer than 7 days, can unlearn certifications without penalty. After
those 7 days however, the 6 hour timer will apply. Occasionally, your character
may be granted a "Forget All" option, normally coinciding with the release of a
major [patch](../terminology/Patch.md), enabling a one-time reset of all
certification points.
