**Infiltration Suit**

While this is not technically armor, the "stealth suit" allows you to cloak
yourself on the battlefield to avoid visual detection. The slower you move, the
less visible you are. When driving a [Wraith](../vehicles/Wraith.md) you may
cloak both yourself and the vehicle. [Darklight](../implants/Darklight.md)
Vision and [Audio Amplifier](../implants/Audio_Amplifier.md)
[Implants](../implants/Implants.md) will aid other players in detecting you. The
Infiltration Suit provides no armor protection, doesn't allow the use of a
rifle, and has a very small inventory.
