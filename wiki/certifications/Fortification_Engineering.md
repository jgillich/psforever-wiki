**Fortification Engineering**

The Fortification Engineering [certification](Certification.md) is one of the
two latest additions to the Engineering tree, along with it's offensive
counterpart [Assault Engineering](Assault_Engineering.md).

This certification is designed for defensive Engineering, and therefor comes
with Deployables that make it harder for Enemies to get inside
[Facilities](../locations/Facilities.md) and [Towers](../locations/Towers.md),
as well as Upgrading abilities for defensive structures like
[Phalanx](../items/Phalanx.md) Wall Turrets.

## Field Deployment Unit (FDU)

This larger version of the
[Adaptive Construction Engine](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md) (ACE)
is used to create the [TRAPs](../weapons/Tactical_Resonance_Area_Protection.md).
It takes up the same size as the biggest Rifles do in your
[inventory](../terminology/Inventory.md). See
[Field Deployment Unit](../weapons/Field_Deployment_Unit.md) for more
information.

## Shadow Turret

This Turret is similar to the [Spitfire Turret](#Spitfire), with the only
difference being that it is invisible, and will only become visible when firing.
For more information see [Shadow Turret](../weapons/Shadow_Turret.md).

## Cerberus Turret

The Cerberus Turret is a modified Spitfire Turret, designed to attack Aircraft
by shooting [Flak](../weapons/Flak.md). It will not attack Infantry unless fired
upon, and doesn't do a lot of damage to them either. For more information see
[Cerberus Turret](../weapons/Cerberus_Turret.md).

## Tactical Resonance Area Protection (TRAP)

The TRAP is designed as a roadblock, to prevent
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) from accessing a certain road. The can take
quite some damage before being destroyed, and do serious damage to anything that
tries to ram them. For more information see
[Tactical Resonance Area Protection](../weapons/Tactical_Resonance_Area_Protection.md).

## Phalanx Wall Turret Upgrades

The Fortification Engineering certification allows Engineers to upgrade the
[Phalanx](../items/Phalanx.md) Wall Turrets at Facilities and Towers. Using the
newly designed [Upgrade Canister](../items/Upgrade_Canister.md) for the
[Nano Dispenser](../weapons/Nano_Dispenser.md) Wall Turrets can be upgraded with
either Anti-Aircraft weaponry or Anti-Vehicular weaponry, besides their default
firing method.

The Wall Turret must be unmanned, and almost at full health if you want to
upgrade the Turret. Upgrading a Turret takes a bit of time, so beware of Enemy
fire while upgrading. Once a Turret has been upgraded you can change Weaponry
again by repeating the process.

Upgrades will last for 30 minutes before reverting to a normal Wall Turret,
after it has reverted, it can of course be upgraded again. Turrets will also
lose their upgrade if the Facility or Towers get captured by an opposing
[Empire](../terminology/Empire.md).

Auto-firing Turrets will only use the default firing method, so if you want to
use the Upgraded Weaponry, you will have to man the Turret yourself.

## Aegis Shield Generator Upgrades

Once an [Assault Engineer](Assault_Engineering.md) has set up an
[Aegis Shield Generator](../weapons/Aegis_Shield_Generator.md), Fortification
Engineers will be able to upgrade it with certain benefits.

The most important benefit is the ability to upgrade the cloaking field with a
Shield. To do this, simply "repair" the Aegis with a
[Nano Dispenser](../weapons/Nano_Dispenser.md) equipped with a normal canister,
and it will start the upgrade process. The Shield Upgrade has priority over all
the other Upgrades that are possible. Once completed, the Aegis will have a
Shield protecting it, similar to that of a Facility that has the
[Shield Module](../items/Shield_Module.md) benefit. Though any fire, both Enemy
and Friendly, directed at the Shield will reduce the Shields power, though the
fire will be blocked from passing through. Once the Shield Generator reaches
zero, it will overload, and explode. The Shield can be recharged if it is below
100% the same way as upgrading the Aegis works.

## Increased Combat Engineering Deployables

With the Fortification Engineering certification you will be able to place
additional numbers of [Combat Engineering](Combat_Engineering.md) Deployables.

The Deployable numbers will be upgraded to:

- [Spitfire Turret](#Spitfire) : From 10 to 15
- [Boomer](#Boomer) : From 20 to 25
- [Motion Sensor](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#motion-sensor-alarm)
  : From 20 to 25
- [Heavy Explosive Mine](#HEMine) : From 20 to 25

## Increased Repair Efficiency

Fortification Engineers use [Armor Canisters](../items/Armor_Canister.md) more
efficiently, resulting in increased repair efficiency for
[MAXes](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) (1.5x, from 12 to 18),
equipment, and [vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) (2x, from 32 to 64) over that
of a standard engineer.
