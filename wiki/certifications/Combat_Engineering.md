**Combat Engineering**

Allows the deployment of [Boomers](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md),
[Mines](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md),
[Spitfires](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md), and
[Motion Sensors](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md). The efficiency of
repairing [MAXes](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md), equipment, and
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) is increased over that of standard engineers
(repairing 14 instead of 12 for MAXs, 48 instead of 32 for vehicles).

This [Certification](Certification.md) is recommended to obtain the
[Engineering]../merits/Engineering\_(Merit).md),
[Saboteur](../merits/Saboteur.md), and
[Universal Soldier](../merits/Universal_Soldier.md)
[Merit Commendations](../merits/index.md).
