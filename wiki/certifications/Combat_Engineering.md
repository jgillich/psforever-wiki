**Combat Engineering**

Allows the deployment of
[Boomers](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md),
[Mines](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md),
[Spitfires](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md), and [Motion
Sensors](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md). The efficiency of
repairing [MAXes](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md), equipment, and
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) is increased over that of standard
engineers (repairing 14 instead of 12 for MAXs, 48 instead of 32 for
vehicles).

This [Certification](certifications/Certification.md) is recommended to obtain
the [Engineering](</Engineering_(Merit)>),
[Saboteur](../merits/Saboteur.md), and [Universal
Soldier](../merits/Universal_Soldier.md) [Merit
Commendations](../merits/Merit_Commendations.md).
