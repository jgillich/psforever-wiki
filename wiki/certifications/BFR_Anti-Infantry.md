**BFR Anti-Infantry**

The Anti-Infantry configuration is designed to quickly take down soft
targets in the form of foot soldiers.

The [VS](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) have the [Continuous
Laser](../weapons/Continuous_Laser.md) which is an anti-infantry beam,
inflicting a steady stream of damage on its target. The laser loses
effectiveness beyond 125 meters, but this is made up by its extreme
precision and devastating effects on infantry and relatively light armor
of [MAX](../items/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) units.

The [TR](../etc/Terran_Republic.md) have the [Rotary
Chaingun](../items/Rotary_Chaingun.md) which is set up to defend against
infantry and air targets. With a high rate of fire, low recoil and heavy
damage, it will shred its targets. Its drawback will be its high rate of
ammo consumption.

The [NC](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md) have the [Hammer](../items/Hammer.md) which is a
serious anti-infantry weapon, firing a wide spread of shredding pellets
over a short range and a secondary fire mode that concentrates the
pellets for medium range work. While the weapon is lethal to infantry
targets, it lacks punch to beat quickly through heavy armored
[vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md).
