**BFR Anti-Aircraft**

The Anti-Aircraft configuration of
[BattleFrame Robotics](../vehicles/BattleFrame_Robotics.md) is best suited to
combat enemy aircraft. At a cost of one
[Certification Point](Certification_points.md), this cert allows the pilot to
utilize three new weapons:

The [VS](../etc/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) have the
[Starfire](<../items/Starfire_(BFR).md>) Anti-Aircraft weaponry which is an
adaptation of the similarly named [MAX](../armor/Starfire.md). It features lock
on systems that will guide in flight projectiles to the currently painted
target. Each energy sphere has an outer plasmoid mass that continues to eat away
at the target after the initial explosive impact.

The [TR](../etc/Terran_Republic.md) have the
[Burster](<../items/Burster_(BFR).md>) air defense system which operates
similarly to the [Burster](../armor/Burster.md) equipped AA MAX, rapidly firing
flak shells that explode in proximity to enemy air.

The [NC](../etc/New_Conglomerate.md) have the
[Sparrow](<../items/Sparrow_(BFR).md>) Missile Pod, which is the application of
the Sparrow Anti-Aircraft weapons platform to the
[Peregrine](../vehicles/Peregrine.md). The system has been adapted for rapid
fire salvo of its magazine of missiles, resulting in fast kill times on opposing
aircraft. The drawback to this is the relatively frequent reload times as
missiles are shuffled into place in the launch tubes.

It should be also noted that all the BFR Anti-Aircraft weapons, even when they
are paired, are still less effective than their
[MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) Unit counterparts.
