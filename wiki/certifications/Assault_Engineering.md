**Assault Engineering**

The new [Assault Engineering](Assault_Engineering.md) is designed for offense,
opposed to it's defensive counterpart
[Fortification Engineering](Fortification_Engineering.md). It has Deployables
and Abilities that give Friendly troops protection in the field, as well as more
fire power.

## Field Deployment Unit (FDU)

This larger version of the Adaptive Construction Engine (ACE) is used to create
the [Aegis Shield Generator](../weapons/Aegis_Shield_Generator.md) as well as
the [One-Manned Field Turrets](../weapons/One-Manned_Field_Turret.md). It takes
up the same size as the biggest Rifles do in your inventory. See
[Field Deployment Unit](../weapons/Field_Deployment_Unit.md) for more
information.

## Aegis Shield Generator

The Aegis Shield Generator provides an area for Friendly troops to safely
Repair/heal themselves, take cover or refill their ammunition, if upgraded. For
more information see
[Aegis Shield Generator](../weapons/Aegis_Shield_Generator.md).

## One-Manned Field Turret (OMFT)

The One-Manned Field Turret, or OMFT for short, has it's own variant for all
three [Empires](../terminology/Empire.md). The
[New Conglomerate](../terminology/New_Conglomerate.md) gets the
[Osprey](../weapons/Osprey.md), the [Terran Republic](../terminology/Terran_Republic.md)
has the [Avenger](../weapons/Avenger.md) and the
[Vanu Sovereignty](../terminology/Vanu_Sovereignty.md) has the
[Orion](../weapons/Orion.md). These Turrets are designed to supress the Enemy in
the Field, and have [weaponry](../weapons/Weapon.md) similar to their
Anti-Infantry [MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) Units. For more
information see
[One-Manned Field Turret](../weapons/One-Manned_Field_Turret.md),
[Osprey](../weapons/Osprey.md), [Avenger](../weapons/Avenger.md) or
[Orion](../weapons/Orion.md).

## Disruptor Mine

Similar to the
[High Explosive Mine](../weapons/Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md#high-explosive-mine)
it detonates when Enemies in range. However, instead of exploding, they emit a
small EMP burst, with affects similar to that of a
[Jammer Grenade](../weapons/Jammer_Grenade.md) or a Commanders EMP. For more
information see [Disruptor Mine](../weapons/Disruptor_Mine.md).

## Ability to place Spitfire Turrets inside Enemy SOIs

Assault Engineers have the special ability to place Spitfire Turrets inside the
SOI of Enemy Facilities and Towers. If used smart, it can keep Enemies locked
inside, and allowing Friendliess to push into the
[courtyard](../locations/Courtyard.md) or even the Facility or Tower itself.

## Ammunition Upgrade for the Aegis Shield Generator

Assault Engineers can Upgrade Aegis Shield Generators with an Ammunition Supply,
allowing friendly Infantry and [MAX](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md)
Units to get ammo. Note that vehicle ammunition and support equipment cannot be
obtained. Upgrading works by use of the
[Nano Dispenser](../weapons/Nano_Dispenser.md) with regular canisters.

## Increased Repair Efficiency

Assault Engineers use [Armor Canisters](../items/Armor_Canister.md) more
efficiently, resulting in increased repair efficiency for
[MAXes](../armor/Mechanized_Assault_Exo-Suit.md) (1.5x, from 12 to 18),
equipment, and [vehicles](../vehicles/index.md) (2x, from 32 to 64) over that
of a standard engineer.
