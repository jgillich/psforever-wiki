# List of Certifications

These skills can be applied to your character at the expense of
[certification points](Certification_points.md), which are earned relative to
the advancement of your [Battle Rank](../terminology/Battle_Rank.md) except on
Battle Rank 6, 12, 18, 24, 25, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36 and 38. Players who have
obtained Battle Rank 40 will have access to all certifications in-game, without
the need to spend certification points.
