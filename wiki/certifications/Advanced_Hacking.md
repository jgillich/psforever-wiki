**Advanced Hacking**

The **Advanced Hacking** certification further reduces the time needed to
[hack](../terminology/Hack.md) objects with a
[REK](../weapons/Remote_Electronics_Kit.md). It also gives the ability to
[jack](../terminology/Jack.md) Enemy [Vehicles](../vehicles/Vehicle.md) (the
vehicle needs to be empty for it to work),
[One-Manned Field Turrets](../weapons/One-Manned_Field_Turret.md) (occupied or
not, but will deconstruct instead of switching to the hacker's Empire), and hack
[Equipment Terminals](../items/Equipment_Terminal.md),
[Vehicle Terminals](../locations/Vehicle_Terminal.md),
[BFR Terminals](../items/BFR_Shed.md) and
[Advanced Medical Terminals](../items/Advanced_Medical_Terminal.md).
[Main Consoles](../items/Main_Terminal.md) can also be hacked provided it is in
a friendly facility with the [generator](../items/Generator.md) online and at
least one active [spawn tube](../items/Respawn_Tube.md).

The [Jacking](../merits/Jacking_(Merit).md) and
[Hack Support Specialist](../merits/Hack_Support_Specialist.md)
[Merit Commendations](../merits/Merit_Commendations.md) can only be obtained by
use of this [Certification](Certification.md).
