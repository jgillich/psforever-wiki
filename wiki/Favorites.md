All [Equipment Terminals](Equipment_Terminal "wikilink"), [Landing
Pads](Landing_Pad "wikilink") and [Repair/Rearm
Silos](Repair/Rearm_Silo "wikilink") allow the current infantry or
vehicle [loadout](loadout "wikilink") to be stored in one of a number of
presets.

Held in the 'Favorites' tab of the terminal interface, these allow the
soldier to instantly equip himself with a previously chosen setup, and
get straight back to business. There are ten slots available for
different infantry [loadouts](loadout "wikilink") at the Equipment
terminal.

Favorites cannot store looted enemy-specific equipment (Use a
[Locker](Locker "wikilink") for these). [Ancient
Technology](Ancient_Technology "wikilink") weapons can be stored as a
favorite, but the actual weapon will not be equipped unless the facility
has an [Equipment Module](Equipment_Module "wikilink") or you are in the
[caverns](cavern "wikilink"). Note that AT Ammo will always be equipped.

Likewise, a vehicle's [Trunk](Trunk "wikilink") contents can be
similarly saved and recalled as needed. The [Landing
Pad](Landing_Pad "wikilink") and [Repair/Rearm
Silo](Repair/Rearm_Silo "wikilink") share a bank of five preset slots.

It is a good idea to prepare at least one of these infantry slots in
advance of major battles, as physical access to the Equipment terminal
of an [Advanced Mobile Station](Advanced_Mobile_Station "wikilink") can
be very limited if lots of people are trying to get equiped at once.

(Note: The Vehicle Slots will store anything currently in the trunk, not
just ammunition for that vehicle. This is particularly useful for
unarmed vehicles, such as the [Wraith](Wraith "wikilink") or
[Lodestar](Lodestar "wikilink"). By taking time to manually load these
trunks beforehand in [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink"), the exact
contents can be replicated at will in the field. e.g. a trunk full of
[Adaptive Construction Engines](Adaptive_Construction_Engine "wikilink")
as a Wraith favorite.)
