Systematik Chaos

A small outfit created by 2 Australians MuscularTeeth and Malkman.

Neither play when the other isnt on. So if you see one expect the other
to be nearby...

The outfit has 10 members in total. 4 are die hards.

Systematik Chaos also have a small website. The main attraction to the
site is its picture gallary. Witness the unique picture of a mosquito in
the spawn room.

Incidently, MuscularTeeth considers himself a frontline journalist on
the field of planetside battle. He has hundred of fantastic and rare
pictures. HART's landed sideways, meteor strikes, 20 newly spawned
soldiers in a single tree and so on. He also has videos of complete
online anarchy. Vehicle columns, massive air combat and dogfights - you
name it. Send him a tell for anything you want.
