The Spooktacular Days is the name of the 2009 Halloween Event that is on
the live [servers](server.md "wikilink") from October 22nd till November
2nd.

## Spooktacular Days

It's that time of year again when all the Ghouls and Goblins come out to
play however this year they've decided to change things up a bit, gone
are the flying skulls and red glowing skies which have been replaced
with the Spooktacular Bonus Experience Days. This years event will run
from October 22nd through November 2nd, and feature some really howling
experience gains. [Base](Facility.md "wikilink") captures like you've never
seen before, cavern captures that will make you want you want get that
next [BFR](BFR.md "wikilink") [imprint](imprint.md "wikilink"), and much more!
So go ahead and spend some time with us and let’s get that much needed
[Battle Experience](Battle_Experience_Points.md "wikilink") and see if we
can reach [Battle Rank](Battle_Rank.md "wikilink") 40... If you dare!!!

[The Chainblade Massacre](The_Chainblade_Massacre.md "wikilink") will also
pop up from time to time throughout the [Spooktacular
Days](Spooktacular_Days.md "wikilink") so be prepared! All players will be
able to use [Cloaking infiltration suits](Infiltration_Suit.md "wikilink")
without need of the [certification](certification.md "wikilink") on
[Extinction](Extinction.md "wikilink") (this is our version of ghosts).

- In true Halloween tradition, players will only be allowed to use a
  Knife to kill other players.
- Players are urged to get proper [Implants](Implant.md "wikilink")
  before entering the zone such as [Darklight](Darklight.md "wikilink")
  in order to see all apparitions.
- The zone has limited [vehicles](vehicle.md "wikilink").
- Knives’ secondary mode will now damage vehicles and equipment. This
  damage should slightly increase with [Melee
  Booster](Melee_Booster.md "wikilink") implants.
- Oh, and don’t worry about damage from vehicles trying to mow you
  over. That has been changed. Nor should you worry about damage from
  an exploding vehicle. Consider yourself in a zombie state under
  these circumstances.
- If a base is drained of its resources, hang tight as they will be
  replenished almost immediately.

Now lets get prepared for some serious experience gain and have a
haunting good time!
