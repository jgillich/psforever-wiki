-   Enabled the [Rocklet Rifle](Rocklet_Rifle "wikilink") to use
    [Fragmentation grenade](Fragmentation_grenade "wikilink") ammo and
    fire them as mini [Flak](Flak "wikilink") rounds that explode in
    proximity to aircraft.
-   Adjusted the [Reaver](Reaver "wikilink") and
    [Mosquito](Mosquito "wikilink")'s maximum health down 5% to reflect
    the "stealth benefit" of gaining 10% more useable armor by not
    losing control when at 10% remaining armor.
-   Adjusted the [Reaver](Reaver "wikilink") weapon systems to promote
    its use against vehicle targets.
    1.  Significantly increased rocket projectile speed and acceleration
        to help better hit moving targets at range
    2.  Decreased rocket damage against infantry
    3.  Decreased rocket splash damage range
    4.  Increased rocket damage against vehicle targets
    5.  Improved Rocket and Gun default [Cone of
