**Peregrine Particle Cannon Ammunition**

This ammo is used by the [Particle Cannon](/Particle_Cannon "wikilink"),
which is the anti-armor gunner weapon of the
[Peregrine](/Peregrine "wikilink"). The rounds are the most damaging
anti-armor rounds in the game. After impact, the rounds leave a minor
irradiation field behind for a few seconds, eating away at the armor of
anything inside. The boxes can be obtained from any [Equipment
Terminal](/Equipment_Terminal "wikilink") to be hand-loaded into the
[BFR](/BFR "wikilink")'s [trunk](/trunk "wikilink") or acquired while in
the BFR from a [Repair/Rearm Silo](/Repair/Rearm_Silo "wikilink").
