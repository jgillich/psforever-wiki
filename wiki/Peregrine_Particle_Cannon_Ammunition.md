**Peregrine Particle Cannon Ammunition**

This ammo is used by the [Particle Cannon](Particle_Cannon.md),
which is the anti-armor gunner weapon of the
[Peregrine](Peregrine.md). The rounds are the most damaging
anti-armor rounds in the game. After impact, the rounds leave a minor
irradiation field behind for a few seconds, eating away at the armor of
anything inside. The boxes can be obtained from any [Equipment
Terminal](Equipment_Terminal.md) to be hand-loaded into the
[BFR](BattleFrame_Robotics.md)'s [trunk](trunk.md) or acquired while in
the BFR from a [Repair/Rearm Silo](Repair_Rearm_Silo.md).
