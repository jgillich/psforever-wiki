PSForever is a fan-based, not-for-profit, emulated server project based on the
original sci-fi MMOFPS. The project is now playable, and has achieved some major
milestones. The project can be found under an open-source license on
GitHub, ready for additional contributions to be made.

Our community gathers every Sunday at 12pm EST to relive the classic MMOFPS experience.
