[Vehicle Terminal](Vehicle_Terminal.md "wikilink") is where you can spawn
[vehicles](Vehicle_Index.md "wikilink") for use. It is typically located in
the [courtyard](courtyard.md "wikilink") of a
[facility](facility.md "wikilink"), with the exception of [Technology
Plants](Technology_Plant.md "wikilink"). The vehicle terminal can be
destroyed by one [High Explosive
Mine](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md "wikilink") and is therefore a common
site for booby traps set by enemy
[Cloakers](Infiltration_Suit.md "wikilink").
