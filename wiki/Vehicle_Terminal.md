[Vehicle Terminal](Vehicle_Terminal.md) is where you can spawn
[vehicles](category:_Vehicles.md) for use. It is typically located in
the [courtyard](courtyard.md) of a
[facility](facility.md), with the exception of [Technology
Plants](Technology_Plant.md). The vehicle terminal can be
destroyed by one [High Explosive
Mine](Adaptive_Construction_Engine.md) and is therefore a common
site for booby traps set by enemy
[Cloakers](Infiltration_Suit.md).
