[Vehicle Terminal](/Vehicle_Terminal "wikilink") is where you can spawn
[vehicles](/Vehicle_Index "wikilink") for use. It is typically located in
the [courtyard](/courtyard "wikilink") of a
[facility](/facility "wikilink"), with the exception of [Technology
Plants](/Technology_Plant "wikilink"). The vehicle terminal can be
destroyed by one [High Explosive
Mine](/Adaptive_Construction_Engine "wikilink") and is therefore a common
site for booby traps set by enemy
[Cloakers](/Infiltration_Suit "wikilink").
