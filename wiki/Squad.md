The squad is the smallest group that can be formed in planetside. Squads
are formed to:

- Share [experience points](Experience_Points.md "wikilink") during
  battles.
- Create a special chat for alerting your squad about threats, needs,
  and directions.
- Gain [Command Experience
  Points](Command_Experience_Points.md "wikilink")
  ([CEP](Acronyms_and_Slang.md "wikilink")) as the leader of a squad.
- [Squad Leaders](Squad_Leader.md "wikilink") can place waypoints on the
  map assuming the [Squad Leader](Squad_Leader.md "wikilink") has the
  appropriate [Command Rank](Command_Rank.md "wikilink").
- Allow players to engage the enemy while close to teammates without
  fear of gaining [Grief points](Grief_points.md "wikilink").
- See waypoints that squadmates make using the [Laze
  Pointer](Laze_Pointer.md "wikilink").
- Allow players to form up and work together by setting a [Squad Home
  Base](Squad_Home_Base.md "wikilink").

A squad can have a maximum of 10 people in the squad. Every kill by a
member of the squad is shared with the rest of the squad as long as the
other members are on the same continent as the kill. Squads also share
[base capture](Capturing_Bases.md "wikilink") experience.
