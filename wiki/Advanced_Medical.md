**Advanced Medical**

If one of your allies has been killed and has not yet clicked the
"respawn" button, their body will remain on ground (once they respawn
their body becomes a [backpack](backpack.md).) Simply point the
[Medical Applicator](Medical_Applicator.md) at them and use it.
You will see a progress bar until they are revived. If the progress bar
dissapears during the process, **don't** let go, it is still reviving,
this is merely a bug.

Revived characters have full health, but zero
[Stamina](Stamina.md) and deactivated
[Implants](Implant.md).

This [Certification](Certification.md) is required to obtain the
[Combat Resuscitation](Combat_Resuscitation.md), [Resuscitation
Medic](Resuscitation_Medic.md), and [Universal
Soldier](Universal_Soldier.md) [Merit
Commendations](Merit_Commendation.md).
