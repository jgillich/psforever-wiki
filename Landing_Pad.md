Repair/Rearm Landing Pad, commonly just refered to as a **Landing Pad**,
is a flat platform structure attached to the causewalks of every
[facility](Facilities "wikilink"), and to the roof of [Air
towers](Air_tower "wikilink"). The base versions have the capability to
(when it is linked to a friendly [Dropship
Center](Dropship_Center "wikilink")) repair any air
[vehicle](Vehicle_Index "wikilink") in the game. Landing Pads can rearm
air vehicles without the Dropship Center benefit.

Landing pads are the only structures that aircraft can land on and not
receive a deconstruction warning message.

Air Towers will both repair and rearm all air vehicles.
