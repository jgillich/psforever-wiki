Each character in [PlanetSide](PlanetSide "wikilink") is a member of one
of three [Empires](Empires "wikilink") (teams):

-   [New Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate "wikilink")
-   [Terran Republic](Terran_Republic "wikilink")
-   [Vanu Sovereignty](Vanu_Sovereignty "wikilink")

Each [Empire](Empires "wikilink") is different in its philosophy, which
carries into the Empire-Specific weapons and vehicles.

Once a character has selected an [Empire](Empires "wikilink") that
character cannot change Empires.
