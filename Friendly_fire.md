**Friendly fire** is damage caused by members of the same
[Empire](Empire "wikilink") to each other. As its name implies, this is
primarily damage caused by [weapons](weapon "wikilink"), but within the
context of [PlanetSide](PlanetSide "wikilink") can also include damage
from [vehicles](vehicle "wikilink") as it relates to
[Grief](Grief_points "wikilink").

Unlike many "traditional" team-based first-person shooters, PlanetSide
does not make members of the same team (Empire) immune to each others
weapons. It is possible to damage and kill one's teammates. This is one
of the features that makes PlanetSide more tactical.
