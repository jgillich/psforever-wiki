The squad is the smallest group that can be formed in planetside. Squads
are formed to:

-   Share [experience points](Experience_Points "wikilink") during
    battles.
-   Create a special chat for alerting your squad about threats, needs,
    and directions.
-   Gain [Command Experience
    Points](Command_Experience_Points "wikilink")
    ([CEP](Acronyms_and_Slang "wikilink")) as the leader of a squad.
-   [Squad Leaders](Squad_Leader "wikilink") can place waypoints on the
    map assuming the [Squad Leader](Squad_Leader "wikilink") has the
    appropriate [Command Rank](Command_Rank "wikilink").
-   Allow players to engage the enemy while close to teammates without
    fear of gaining [Grief points](Grief_points "wikilink").
-   See waypoints that squadmates make using the [Laze
    Pointer](Laze_Pointer "wikilink").
-   Allow players to form up and work together by setting a [Squad Home
    Base](Squad_Home_Base "wikilink").

A squad can have a maximum of 10 people in the squad. Every kill by a
member of the squad is shared with the rest of the squad as long as the
other members are on the same continent as the kill. Squads also share
[base capture](Capturing_Bases "wikilink") experience.

Below is a picture of the mini-squad member list that appears on your
[Heads-up Display](Heads-up_Display "wikilink")
[HUD](Acronyms_and_Slang "wikilink").
