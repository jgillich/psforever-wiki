[Facility](Facility "wikilink") with a Shield Module Benefit\]\]
![](Shield_module.jpg "fig:Shield_module.jpg") Installing this
[Module](modules "wikilink") provides the [Module
Benefit](module_benefit "wikilink") of powering a Force Field across the
Gate, or openings in the [Courtyard](Courtyard "wikilink") wall.

This Force Field stops ALL weapon fire. Most Vehicles cannot pass
through it and Enemy Infantry speed is slowed to Walk Speed while
passing through the Shield. The [Vindicator](Vindicator "wikilink"),
[Juggernaut](Juggernaut "wikilink"), and
[Leviathan](Leviathan "wikilink") can pass through the shield with no
penalty.

Friendly Infantry and Vehicles can pass through the Force Field without
receiving Speed Penalties.

This module appears as aqua on the [Continental
Map](Continental_Map "wikilink").
