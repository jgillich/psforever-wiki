A hill perimeter surrounds the only facility, [Atar](Atar "wikilink"), a
[Dropship Center](Dropship_Center "wikilink"), linked by two
[Warpgates](Warpgate "wikilink") and a [Geowarp](Geowarp "wikilink").

This critical island lynchpin connects
[Extinction](Extinction "wikilink") to
[Ascension](Ascension "wikilink"), while having no connections at all to
other planets. The connected [Geowarp](Geowarp "wikilink") is always
inactive and never connects to a [Cavern](Cavern "wikilink") at the
present time.

[Towers](Tower "wikilink") on the hill rim can only be accessed from
footpaths on the outside of the hills, so be aware that they are
different challenges to attack and defend.

Foot trails (not wide enough for vehicles) will often take you to
interesting objectives around the map. Look for foot trails from the
warpgates that lead you to these hidden paths.

As is the case with all [Battle Islands](Battle_Islands "wikilink"),
heavy weapons and vehicles do not operate here. Not permitted are [Heavy
Assault](Heavy_Assault "wikilink") weapons,
[Reavers](Reaver "wikilink"), [Artillery](Artillery "wikilink"),
[BFRs](BFR "wikilink"), [Medium Battle
Tanks](Medium_Battle_Tank "wikilink"), and Empire Specific
[Deliverer](Deliverer "wikilink") variants.
