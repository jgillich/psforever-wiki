**Spiker**

With the discovery of the Core Complex came the introduction of the
[Spiker](Spiker "wikilink") medium assault weapon. Now known as "[The
Potato](Acronyms_and_Slang#P "wikilink")", the
[Spiker](Spiker "wikilink") is a slingshot-type weapon with amazing
impact and splash damage, making it a
[cloaker](Infiltration_Suit "wikilink") favorite. The longer the fire
key is held before release, the more powerful the projectile. There is a
maximum, however, and the weapon will make a distinctive sound when the
maximum is reached. When at maximum power, the ammo will start counting
down (to maintain power), thus careful managing of the trigger is needed
to best conserve ammo.

While the weapon is classified as a pistol, it requires the [Medium
Assault](Medium_Assault "wikilink") certification to purchase, yet fits
into the pistol inventory slot, allowing its use by cloakers. In
addition, unless the user is in the core, the base must have an
[Equipment Module](Equipment_Module "wikilink") installed for the weapon
to be purchased. Many players circumvent this by placing large caches of
the weapon into their [lockers](lockers "wikilink"), making them
available anywhere on the battlefield.
