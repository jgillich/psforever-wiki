Empire's Sanctuary island is secure from all enemy attacks. This island
is a hub of ways to move about the Auraxian Planetary Web, as well as a
safe place to meet and train. As of Version 3.4, each Sanctuary has a
fixed link to two [continents](continent "wikilink"), called [Home
Continents](Home_Continent "wikilink").

### Sanctuary Layout and Resources

The [HART shuttle](HART "wikilink") departs regularly and enables
soldiers to use [Drop Pods](Drop_Pod "wikilink") to streak down from
orbit down to the target continent below. This is the fastest, safest
way to travel to a new battlefield, however, vehicles cannot travel this
way.

[Respawn Buildings](Respawn_Building "wikilink") are located
conveniently near each [HART launch structure](HART_building "wikilink")
where combat troops can safely login or regroup.

There are also [Warpgates](Warpgate "wikilink") that let you travel
directly to other continents. You can take vehicles through these Gates,
so they're useful when massing attacks or moving support vehicles out of
the Sanctuary. All three warpgates in the sanctuary are [broadcast
warpgates](broadcast_warpgate "wikilink").

Are you in need of hands-on training with any of the weapons or vehicles
available to your Empire? Go to [VR training](VR_training "wikilink")
around the corner from the [Respawn
Building](Respawn_Building "wikilink") doors.

And finally, there are three [Villas](Villa "wikilink") around your
Sanctuary island. Sometimes it's convenient to meet a friend at one of
those Villas. To get there easily, step into one of the
[teleporters](teleporter "wikilink") near the [HART Shuttle
building](HART_building "wikilink").
