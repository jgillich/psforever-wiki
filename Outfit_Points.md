Outfit Points are contributed to Players that are in an
[Outfit](Outfit "wikilink").

For every 100
[BEP](Battle_Experience_Points "wikilink")/[SEP](Support_Experience_Points "wikilink")
and every 50 [Command Experience
Points](Command_Experience_Points "wikilink") gained, the Player is
awarded 1 Outfit Point.

When an Outfit reaches 10.000 Outfit Points, it can select an [Outfit
Decal](Outfit_Decal "wikilink").

Outfit Points don't do anything for the Player, except show how much he
has contributed to the [Outfit](Outfit "wikilink").

Outfit Points are lost when leaving the Outfit.
