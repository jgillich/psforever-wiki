A **certification** (cert) is a soldier attribute that allows him or her
to operate specific classes equipment.

[Certifications](Certifications "wikilink") are obtained at the expense
of [Certification points](Certification_points "wikilink"), which are
earned through game experience.

Some certifications have prerequisites that must be obtained in order.

Certs can be forgotten every 6 hours.

New Characters have a 7 day grace period, and don't have a penalty for
unlearning Certifications. After these 7 days, they will have to wait 6
hours to unlearn Certifications again though.

You may only forget one certification at a time. However, if you forget
a cert that serves as a prerequisite for others, any dependant
certifications will be forgotten as well.

For example, if you have a [BFR](BFR "wikilink") certification and you
forget [Armored Assault I](Armored_Assault_I "wikilink"), you will lose
three certs: [Armored Assault I](Armored_Assault_I "wikilink"), [Armored
Assault II](Armored_Assault_II "wikilink"), and BFR. If you also had
[BFR Anti-Aircraft](BFR_Anti-Aircraft "wikilink"), [BFR
Anti-Infantry](BFR_Anti-Infantry "wikilink"), and
[Flail](Flail "wikilink"), you will forget those as well.

With the release of version [3.11](3.11 "wikilink"), characters will
receive the option to "forget all" certifications. This option is only
usable once, until the next major release, at which time each character
will again receive the option.

[Certification Terminals](Certification_Terminal "wikilink") can be
found in the [HART building](HART_building "wikilink") of your
[Empire](Empire "wikilink")'s [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink"), and in
[Bio Laboratories](Bio_Laboratory "wikilink").
