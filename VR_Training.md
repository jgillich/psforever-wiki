[Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink")\]\] The VR Training area can be found
in [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink"), in the same building as the spawn
tubes. The area is divided in to two sections; the Shooting Range and
Driving Area.

## Shooting Range

The Shooting Range contains a set of [Equipment
terminals](Equipment_terminal "wikilink") and a large area populated
with holographic enemy infantry, MAX Units and light vehicles.

While in the Shooting Range, all
[certification](certification "wikilink") restrictions are lifted,
allowing any soldier to use any of their own Empire's available
equipment. (The exception to this is the [Command Uplink
Device](Command_Uplink_Device "wikilink"), which still requires [Command
Rank](Command_Rank "wikilink") 2 or more to requisition.)

Even though the holographic targets are largely stationary, this still
provides a useful place to experiment with the various weapons in a calm
and controlled setting.

It is not possible to experiment with an enemy empire's specific
equipment here.

[Favorites](Favorites "wikilink") may be saved here, just as at any
other Equipment Terminal. To leave the Shooting Range, enter the
Teleport column in the centre of the room.

## Driving Range

The Driving Area consists of a small holographic
[continent](continent "wikilink") with similar features to one of the
real temperate planets, such as [Cyssor](Cyssor "wikilink") or
[Amerish](Amerish "wikilink"). It is dotted with [Vehicle
Terminals](Vehicle_Terminal "wikilink"), a [BFR
Shed](BFR_Shed "wikilink") and a [Dropship
Terminal](Dropship_Terminal "wikilink"), located across the bridge to
the east of the start point. This island provides an excellent
opportunity to gain a feel for the handling characteristics of any of
the available vehicles, and their guns.

As with the Shooting Range, certification restrictions are lifted for
the duration of the soldier's session here, allowing any of their
Empire's vehicles to be selected and tested. Unfortunately, there are no
targets in this area to practice vehicle gunnery on, apart from trees
and rocks.

While not normally available, enemy empire-specific vehicles can be
acquired here if your empire has [locked](Continental_lock "wikilink")
both [Home Continents](Home_Continent "wikilink") of an enemy empire, or
has gained enemy vehicles through an [event](event "wikilink").

There is a [Repair Silo](Repair_Silo "wikilink") located next to the
starting vehicle terminal, allowing Favorites to be saved, and BFR
weapons to be changed. To exit the Driving Area, exit any vehicle, and
walk into one of the columns dotted about the map.

Once VR Training is exited, normal certification restrictions apply.

(Note: This area is especially important for new recruits, as
experimenting with each weapon and vehicle will grant bonus [Experience
Points](Experience_Points "wikilink"), and it is quite easy to attain
[Battle Rank](Battle_Rank "wikilink") four in VR Training alone. This
means you start active duty with ten [Certification
points](Certification_points "wikilink") to spend, instead of seven.)
