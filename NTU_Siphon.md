**NTU Siphon**

The NTU Siphon is a [BFR](BFR "wikilink") pilot weapon. While each
empire has their own unique NTU Siphon model, they function identically.

The NTU Siphon has two modes. The first draws [NTUs](NTU "wikilink")
from active [Warpgates](Warpgate "wikilink") or enemy [NTU
Silos](NTU_Silo "wikilink"). The Siphon can only drain a silo to 50%
NTUs, although if anything is damaged in the base, the silo will show
40%. Attempting to drain a silo beyond this level will have no effect.
You can also refill friendly NTU Silos in this mode, assuming you have
filled your capacitor. Similar to an [ANT](ANT "wikilink"), you will
recieve [BEP](BEP "wikilink") for filling friendly silos. For every 2
NTUs you siphon, only 1 unit can be put back into a friendly base. A BFR
with two full siphons can fill a base to approximately 30%. A BFR can
only use one NTU Siphon at a time, but can equip Siphons on both arms.

The second mode is the [EMP](EMP "wikilink") mode. The Siphon must have
at least 30 NTUs gathered in the primary mode to use as an EMP. When
activated, an EMP is expelled (identical to one called by a
[CUD](CUD "wikilink")). An EMP can only be expelled every 20 seconds or
so.

[Jammer Grenades](Jammer_Grenade "wikilink") and EMP blasts will disable
the NTU Siphon completely for a short time (unlike traditional BFR
weapons that simply receive rate of fire penalties).

Uses for this weapon include draining enemy NTUs to drain the base
quicker, using the [EMP](EMP "wikilink") to clear mines, and using the
[EMP](EMP "wikilink") in conjuction with an [Armor
Siphon](Armor_Siphon "wikilink") to attack enemy [BFRs](BFR "wikilink").
