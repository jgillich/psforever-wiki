**Phantasm**

The Phantasm is cloaked troop transport that requires a [Technology
Plant](Technology_Plant "wikilink") link or
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") [Air
Terminal](Air_Terminal "wikilink") to be purchasable. It can carry 4
passengers and can be cloaked by the pilot by pressing the "B" key by
default.

Traveling at speeds greater than 40 km/h (between 20% and 30% throttle)
will make the [vehicle](vehicle "wikilink") slightly visible (note that
at 30% throttle (42 km/h) you will appear cloaked on your screen but
others will see a slight outline). Strafing, rising, or descending while
traveling over 14 km/h will also expose the aircraft. Traveling at
speeds above 50% throttle will create visible contrails on the wings of
aircraft and enemies can easily see it at great distances.

Note that there is a bug where sometimes enemies can see the phantasm's
opacity as if it were traveling at 100% throttle even if it is nearly
stationary. This is annoying as not all enemies are affected, but if one
sees you and starts shooting, many others follow. One tactic to combat
this bug, if you notice enemies at great distance shooting your
stationary phantasm, is to descend so that your landing struts extend.
This sometimes fixes the bug. If that doesn't work, you need to fly past
the drawing distance of the enemies, get out of the vehicle, then get in
again.

The Phantasm has the greatest sustainable speed of any aircraft in the
game. Over reasonable distances, it is the only aircraft other than the
[Wasp](Wasp "wikilink") that can outrun a
[Mosquito](Mosquito "wikilink") if the afterburner is applied optimally.
The trade-off is that the Phantasm has very poor acceleration and
deceleration, thus changes in speed must be planned well in advance
(especially when preparing to land).

Lock-on weapons are ineffective against the Phantasm while cloaked,
though [Flak](Flak "wikilink") will still explode in proximity to it.
Automated defense systems will not fire on a cloaked phantasm. An enemy
cloaked phantasm inside the [SOI](SOI "wikilink") of a base with
[interlink](interlink "wikilink")
[benefits](Facility_Linked_Benefit "wikilink") will show up on the
[proximity map](Proximity_Map "wikilink") of friendly players.

The pilot can wear up to [Agile Exo-Suit](Agile_Exo-Suit "wikilink")
armor, and can earn the [Galaxy Support
Pilot](Galaxy_Support_Pilot "wikilink") [merit](merit "wikilink") for
kills made by players after they bail from the aircraft.
