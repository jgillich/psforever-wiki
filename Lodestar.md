**Lodestar**

![](Lodestar_NC.jpg "fig:Lodestar_NC.jpg") Lodestar carries an
[AMS](AMS "wikilink")\]\] The **Lodestar** is a massive, shoebox shaped
aircraft designed to carry any vehicle and also act as a remote
repair/rearm station. Infantry may not be directly transported by the
Lodestar, but must be inside a vehicle.

Extremely poor maneuverability, a gigantic profile, and a complete lack
of weaponry leave the Lodestar with only its impressive armor as means
for survival, although the Lodestar does have an
[Afterburner](Afterburner "wikilink").

Vehicles in transit may Hotdrop in a similar manner to infantry in a
[Galaxy](Galaxy "wikilink"), (Default 'Alt-G') but must take extra care
to ensure the landing area is flat and driveable. Vehicles landing on
rooftops, walls, walkways and railings face massive damage and
desconstruction.

Vehicles being carried by the Lodestar are protected by an energy field,
rendering them immune to damage. However, they may not shoot out of the
field, and will be destroyed with the Lodestar if still aboard.

When landed, the Lodestar provides a mobile repair/rearm station.
Friendly vehicles simply drive (or hover) close to the Lodestar and they
are autorepaired. They can also rearm their vehicle in the same way as
can be done at the base's [Repair/Rearm
Silo](Repair/Rearm_Silo "wikilink"), making them very valuable for
attacks on distant enemy bases. By piloting the lodestar and assisting
others in this way, one can earn the [Lodestar
Support](Lodestar_Support "wikilink") merits.

The [Lodestar](Lodestar "wikilink") can only be purchased at a [Dropship
Center](Dropship_Center "wikilink") or in the
[Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") and requires the [Air
Support](Air_Support "wikilink")
[certification](certifications "wikilink").

The Lodestar's apparent namesake is the [Lockheed
Lodestar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lockheed_Lodestar)
