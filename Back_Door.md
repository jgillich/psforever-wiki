The Back Door is the entry point to the inside of a
[Facility](facilities "wikilink") which is located outside of the
facilities [Courtyard](Courtyard "wikilink"). It is an Infantry-only
area, with a door too small for any [Vehicles](Vehicles "wikilink").

The only built-in defense for a Back Door is a simple
[IFF](IFF "wikilink") lock.

However, due to the design of the facility, the back door ("BD") is
inherently easy to defend with a small group. The door connects to a
long, low-grade sloping interior hallway with 90 or 180 degree bends
before opening into the facility's lower levels.

This hallway, when populated with defenders, is impassable via
conventional means, although it is sometimes susceptible to the [MAX
Crash](MAX_Crash "wikilink") rapid-advance tactic.
