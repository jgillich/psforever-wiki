There are several kinds of maps available in Planetside:

-   [Interstellar Map](Interstellar_Map "wikilink") - also called
    Galactic or Global Map.
-   [Continental Map](Continental_Map "wikilink") - also called
    continent, planetary, or overhead map; shows view of selected
    continent.
-   Cluster View Map - shows view of a selected island in a cluster.
-   Cavern Map - shows view of selected cavern.

These maps are sometimes collectively refered to as the Game Map or
Overhead Map.

There is also another map that appears on your [HUD](HUD "wikilink")
screen, but has different features. This is the [Proximity
Map](Proximity_Map "wikilink"), also called Proximity Radar or Radar
Map.
