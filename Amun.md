Amun is a [Sub-Capitol](Sub-Capitol "wikilink") and [Technology
Plant](Technology_Plant "wikilink") on southern
[Solsar](Solsar "wikilink"). Nearby are a [Watch
tower](Watch_tower "wikilink"), 235m to the south, and [Bio
Laboratory](Bio_Laboratory "wikilink") [Horus](Horus "wikilink"),
approximately 400m to the west.

The front door faces north, and there is a [pillbox](pillbox "wikilink")
outside the southern gate, facing the [Watch
tower](Watch_tower "wikilink").

There are hills to the west, east, and south that provide good sniping
points. Any flat terrain near the base is filled with trees and rocks,
practically forcing [vehicles](vehicle "wikilink") to stay on the road.
