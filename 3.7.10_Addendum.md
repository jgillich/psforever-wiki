Version 3.7.10 Addendum (July 18, 2005)

-   Changed the [AMS Support](AMS_Support "wikilink") and [Lodestar
    Support](Lodestar_Support "wikilink")
    [Merits](Merit_Commendations "wikilink") to only use Respawn
    [Assists](Assist "wikilink") and Repair Assists respectively to
    remove a numeration issue that was causing progression on these
    awards to not function as expected. These changes do not alter any
    of the numbers of assist kills or any of your statisitics. It only
    changed the "filter" that looks at your stats and decides wether or
    not to award the merit to you.
