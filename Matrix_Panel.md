Allows a soldier to [bind](bind "wikilink") to a location as a [spawn
point](spawn_point "wikilink") after death or
[deconstruction](deconstruct "wikilink"). Matrix Panels are located on
the side of [respawn tubes](respawn_tube "wikilink") and on the front of
[AMSes](Advanced_Mobile_Station "wikilink"). They are also located in
other various locations of a base, such as the [main
lobby](main_lobby "wikilink"), basement areas, and the air vehicle room
at [Dropship Centers](Dropship_Center "wikilink").

To bind to a panel, approach and press the "G" key when prompted to do
so.

To unbind, approach and press the "G" key again when prompted and your
bind will be erased.

Soldiers that have the [Expert Hacking](Expert_Hacking "wikilink")
[certification](certification "wikilink") can use the Matrix Panel to
upgrade the [Spawn Room](Spawn_Room "wikilink") [Pain
Field](Pain_Field "wikilink") so that it will do increased damage. This
is done by equipping the [REK](REK "wikilink"), aiming it at the Matrix
Panel, and pressing the "Primary Fire" button. A progress bar will
appear similar to the one received when hacking a [Control
Console](Control_Console "wikilink"). The [Pain
Module](Pain_Module "wikilink") benefit and this process are stackable.
Spawn rooms that have upgraded pain fields from expert hackers show a
special icon on the [Continental Map](Continental_Map "wikilink") and
will last for 30 minutes after the last boost.
