**Vulture**

This close-support bomber is a modified
[Liberator](Liberator "wikilink") airframe. It has a smaller payload but
improved speed and handling, as well as afterburners. It lacks the
pilot's downward-facing 'bomber mode' camera and cannot equip
anti-infantry cluster bombs.

The pilot's 35mm nose cannon has a high rate of fire and more focused
armor damage, but is less damaging to infantry and aircraft. There also
less rounds per clip, with only 75 which can be completely spent in
approximately 5 seconds.

The bombs that the Vulture carries are significantly more powerful
against armor than the anti-armor bombs of a standard Liberator. A
standard A/V bomb does 600 damage, and the Vulture's bombs do 1500
damage. This increase in power is offset by the fact that it carries
less bombs and only permits five bombs per clip. The release rate of the
bombs is also somewhat slower, as it the fall speed. Vultures can also
release bombs at a slightly lower altitude than the Liberator. Their
combination of superior speed and maneuverability with the limitations
of bomb payload make the Vulture best suited to low level close support
bombing.

The tailgun of the Vulture also differs from the Liberator. The
Vulture's tailgun holds only 100 rounds per clip instead of 150, but it
is more powerful than that of the liberator, and can be used against
ground targets with much success.

The [trunk](trunk "wikilink") of the Vulture is slightly smaller than
the Liberator, able to carry 8 4x4 boxes instead of 9 like the
Liberator. Because of this, Liberator [favorites](favorites "wikilink")
cannot be seamlessly loaded into the Vulture, requiring a seperate
favorite slot for dedicated Vulture users.

Only experienced Liberator pilots are cleared to operate Vulture.
Obtaining one from a flight vehicle terminal will require not only the
[Air Support](Air_Support "wikilink") certification, but also a [Bomber
Ace](Bomber_Ace "wikilink") Bronze [Merit
Commendation](Merit_Commendation "wikilink"). Like the Liberator, the
Vulture requires a [Technology Plant](Technology_Plant "wikilink")
lattice link or [Sanctuary](Sanctuary "wikilink") vehicle pad in order
to be purchasable.
