**Disruptor Mine**

The Disruptor Mine is very similar to the [High Explosive
Mine](Adaptive_Construction_Engine#High_Explosive_Mine "wikilink"),
apart from a few changes in appearance and behavior.

Disruptor Mines work the same as their High Explosive Mine counterparts,
however, when triggered, they do not explode, but rather emit a small
EMP burst.

The Disruptor Mine EMP burst has the same effect as [Jammer
Grenades](Jammer_Grenade "wikilink") and the EMP used by Commanders
except that it will not detonate [boomers](boomer "wikilink") or [High
Explosive
Mines](Adaptive_Construction_Engine#High_Explosive_Mine "wikilink")
(neither Friendly nor Enemy).

The Disruptor Mine shares the secondary firing mode of the
[ACE](ACE "wikilink") with the High Explosive Mine, and can be selected
by use of the "Change Ammunition" function.

The Disruptor Mines count for the maximum number of mines that you can
deploy, along with the High Explosive Mine. Their interference range is
similar to their High Explosive counterparts.
