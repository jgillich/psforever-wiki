A **Zone** is a general term referring to an individual area of the
persistent world's geography.

In terms of [Server](Server "wikilink") topography, a zone is supported
by a server or a server cluster working in unison, allowing characters
to interact with each other within the zone.

Entering and leaving a zone will also instruct the
[Client](Client "wikilink") to load and unload the graphical resources
needed to display that area.

Zones in [PlanetSide](PlanetSide "wikilink") are referred to as
[Planets](Planet "wikilink"), [Continents](Continent "wikilink"), and
[Caverns](Cavern "wikilink").
