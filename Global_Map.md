![](Global_Map.jpg "fig:Global_Map.jpg") The [Global
Map](Global_Map "wikilink") was the way
[PlanetSide](PlanetSide "wikilink") originally showed the ten continents
and three sanctuaries. Before [The Bending](The_Bending "wikilink")
occurred, all of [Auraxis](Auraxis "wikilink") was still one planet.
Therefore, the ten [continents](continent "wikilink") and three
[sanctuaries](sanctuary "wikilink") were all displayed on one map
displaying Auraxis as one world of ten continents. However, after The
Bending, Auraxis was split up into many different planets, and the
Global Map was replaced by the [Interstellar
Map](Interstellar_Map "wikilink"), and the Global Map became no longer
accessible in game.

Along with the Global Map was the Cavern Map, which showed the six [Core
Combat](Core_Combat "wikilink") [Caverns](Caverns "wikilink"). These
were displayed in a circle with the active caverns shown and the time to
unlock for the other four caverns. However, with The Bending, the cavern
map was removed, as the caverns were now described as asteroids and
became a part of the Interstellar Map.

Along with the [Interstellar Map](Interstellar_Map "wikilink") came the
[Battle Islands](Battle_Islands "wikilink") and the removal of
[Oshur](Oshur "wikilink").

## Advantages of the Global Map

Many players are critical of the Interstellar Map, saying that the
Global Map has certain advantages over the Interstellar Map.

### Visible Lattice

With the Global Map, some users contend that the
[Lattice](Lattice "wikilink") was more obvious. By clicking on a
continent, a player could see which continent linked to what other
continents and which [warpgates](warpgate "wikilink") are used. With the
Interstellar Map, a player can only tell which continents link to each
other, but must investigate the continent to find out which warpgates
are used to link two continents together.

### Population Locks

On the Global Map, [Population Locks](Population_Lock "wikilink") were
very obvious to the user, as a population indicator for the player's
[Empire](Empire "wikilink") was placed on every continent in Auraxis
that made it obvious to the player whether or not they could go to that
continent due to population. However, with the Interstellar Map, a
player must click on each individual planet to see how many spots are
left on that particular planet.

### Traveling Weather

With the Global Map, it was obvious to a player when
[weather](weather "wikilink") patterns are going to move from continent
to continent. However, this is completely impossible to tell with the
Interstellar Map, and storms seem to be entirely random.

## Criticism of the Interstellar Map

Many users complain about the Interstellar Map and want the Global Map
back at least as an option over the Interstellar Map for the reasons
stated above. Other users cite this as pointless as Auraxis is not a
single planet anymore, and that the Interstellar Map performs all of the
jobs that the Global Map did just fine.
