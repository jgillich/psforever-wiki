![](AphelionPicture.jpg "fig:AphelionPicture.jpg")'s Gunner Variant
[BFR](BFR "wikilink")\]\]

The Aphelion is the gunner variant of [BattleFrame
Robotics](BattleFrame_Robotics "wikilink") developed by the [Vanu
Sovereignty](Vanu_Sovereignty "wikilink"). While lacking the engagement
range of the [Colossus](Colossus "wikilink") and
[Peregrine](Peregrine "wikilink"), the Aphelion can pack a punch if an
enemy gets too close. Many players complain of getting "sea sick" in the
gunner's pod, as it shakes more violently than the other empires' BFRs
when running.

Gunner variants have, in addition the the pilot weapons, an extra gunner
pod on their backs where a second soldier can mount a secondary gun
mounted atop the BFR. They also have more armor and a faster shield
regeneration then their flight counter parts giving them more of a
"staying power."

The Flight Variant of the Aphelion is the [Eclipse](Eclipse "wikilink").

## Pilot Weapons

The Pilot Weapons that the Aphelion can obtain are

-   The [Continuous Laser](Continuous_Laser "wikilink") (Anti-Infantry)
-   The [Pulsed Particle
    Accelerator](Pulsed_Particle_Accelerator_(BFR) "wikilink")
    (Anti-Vehicular)
-   The [Starfire](Starfire_(BFR) "wikilink") (Anti-Aircraft)
-   The [NTU Siphon](NTU_Siphon "wikilink")
-   The [Armor Siphon](Armor_Siphon "wikilink") (Anti-Vehicular)

The pilot has room for two such weapons at a time and can be two of the
same weapon, or two different weapons.

## Gunner Weapons

The gunner weapons available to the Aphelion are

-   The [Immolation Cannon](Immolation_Cannon "wikilink")
    (Anti-Vehicular)
-   The[Plasma Mortars](Plasma_Mortar "wikilink") (Anti-Infantry)

Only one gunner weapon can be used at a time.

## History

![](Aphelions.jpg "fig:Aphelions.jpg")\]\] The currently-fielded unit
named "Aphelion" varies from the pictured unit. When introduced, the
two-man version of the [VS](VS "wikilink") battleframe was named the
**Orion**. It was renamed "Aphelion" in patch [3.2.6](3.2.6 "wikilink"),
and the original one-man Aphelion retired from service.
