Flak projectiles are specifically designed to combat aircraft. The round
is propelled at high velocity in a fairly straight trajectory until it
detects an hostile air target within proximity, upon which it explodes
violently, scatering small pieces of shrapnel in a very wide spherical
radius, causing large amounts of damage to air vehicle armor.

Flak can be tricky to use, as it does not lock on to targets like most
other Anti-Air weapon systems, but requires the gunner to anticipate
fast moving and distant craft. However, as it does not lock on, the
first warning a pilot will get is when the shells begin exploding around
them. At this point, unless they are already moving, and have an
[Afterburner](Afterburner "wikilink") ready, is it generally too late to
react to the bombardment. This makes it an ideal choice to ambush
hovering aircraft.

Most Flak has a maximum range of 500m (exception:
[Flaklet](Rocklet_Rifle "wikilink")) thus it can hit aircraft flying at
the 400m ceiling if sufficiently leading the target, although it can
cause splash damage if used with 10m or so. Flak is generally
ineffective indoors, or against ground vehicles, MAX and infantry, as
the shells will not proximity-detonate. Direct hits with the shells
causes only minor armor damage to the target.

Best used against [Mosquitos](Mosquito "wikilink"),
[Reavers](Reaver "wikilink") and [Wasps](Wasp "wikilink"), several Flak
guns working in concert will generally be required to eliminate
[Liberators](Liberator "wikilink"), [Lodestars](Lodestar "wikilink") and
the [Galaxy](Galaxy "wikilink"), by virtue of their large armor,
although steady bombardment will generally force a retreat of these
craft.
