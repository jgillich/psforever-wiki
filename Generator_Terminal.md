The [Generator Terminal](Generator_Terminal "wikilink") is located at
the entrance of the [Generator](Generator "wikilink") of each
[base](base "wikilink"). Friendly [Expert
Hackers](Expert_Hacking "wikilink") can use their [REK](REK "wikilink")
to hack into the terminal to divert power to generate a [Pain
Field](Pain_Field "wikilink") in the generator room. The pain field
created by this process is the equivalent of a [Pain
Module](Pain_Module "wikilink") in terms of strength. If the facility is
receiving a Pain Module benefit and also upgraded in this manner, the
pain field has intense strength (3 times stronger than a pain module
pain field).

Facilities with upgraded generator pain fields will display a special
icon on the [Continental Map](Continental_Map "wikilink") and will last
for 30 minutes after the last boost.
