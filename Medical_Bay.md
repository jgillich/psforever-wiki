Only [Bio Laboratories](Bio_Laboratory "wikilink") have Medical Bays.

The Medical Bay features an [Advanced Medical
Terminal](Advanced_Medical_Terminal "wikilink"), several
[Lockers](Locker "wikilink"), and a [Matrix
Panel](Matrix_Panel "wikilink"). The room is white and red colored with
various medical equipment in cabinets and on tables. However, besides
the Advanced Medical Terminal and lockers, it isn't usable.

The Medical Bay is accessable from the [Main
lobby](Main_lobby "wikilink") of the Bio Laboratory.
