## Topography

The sand dunes that stretch across most of the island provide enough
cover for vehiles to go "hull down" against, and for infantry to use as
LOS blocks. Squads of infantry and vehicles will do best here when
coordinated as groups. Stragglers that try to cross the dunes alone are
ripe for snipers and air cavalry.

## Limitations

As is the case with all [Battle Islands](Battle_Islands "wikilink"),
heavy weapons and vehicles do not operate here. Not permitted are [Heavy
Assault](Heavy_Assault "wikilink") weapons,
[Reavers](Reaver "wikilink"), [Artillery](Artillery "wikilink"),
[BFRs](BFR "wikilink"), [Medium Battle
Tanks](Medium_Battle_Tank "wikilink"), and Empire Specific
[Deliverer](Deliverer "wikilink") variants.

## [Facilities](Facilities "wikilink")

All three bases on this island are [LLU](LLU "wikilink")-capture
[Technology Plants](Technology_Plant "wikilink"). The lack of a [Bio
Laboratory](Bio_Laboratory "wikilink") here means that spawn times are
not modified by anything but [Modules](Modules "wikilink").

### [Technology Plants](Technology_Plant "wikilink")

-   [Dahaka](Dahaka "wikilink")
-   [Izha](Izha "wikilink")
-   [Jamshid](Jamshid "wikilink")
