Animation culling is the process of cutting certain frames of animation
(such as a soldier running or the wheels on a
[vehicle](vehicle "wikilink")) to help improve frame rates on less
powerful machines.

The settings for this feature can be found in game under the "Advanced"
tab under "Video" options.
