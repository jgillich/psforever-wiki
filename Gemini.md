Gemini is the only remaining server for
[Planetside](Planetside "wikilink"), located on the East coast of the
United States. On May 20, 2008, the [Markov](Markov "wikilink") and
[Emerald](Emerald "wikilink") servers combined to form Gemini. On August
25, 2009 [Werner](Werner "wikilink") was also merged into the Gemini
server.

Character and [Outfit](Outfit "wikilink") names that were not unique to
both Markov and Emerald had a "-M" (for Markov) or a "-E" (for Emerald),
appended to the name if the name did not have priority. The same method
was used for the Werner merge with a "-W" (for Werner) and a "-G" (for
Gemini) appended. See the official Markov/Emerald announcement below for
information about how name priorities are decided and how to change the
character or outfit name if it did not have priority. The same method
was used for both the Markov/Emerald and Werner/Gemini merges.

## Official Announcement

With the goal of maintaining a high level of battle between the three
Empires of PlanetSide, the two North American servers, Markov and
Emerald, will be merged into one server on May 20, 2008. The new server
will be named Gemini to represent the two long standing servers.

When the merge occurs, characters will be given a special merit to
represent their loyalty to their former server. Native Markov characters
will receive a different merit than their Emerald counterparts which
will be obtained and visible upon logging into the Gemini server for the
very first time.

A concern that occurs when merging servers is Character Name conflicts.
What happens if there are two characters with the same name from the two
servers? Who gets the name and who has to change their name? The rules
below will help to explain the different scenarios that may occur during
the merge process as well as the rules for Outfit Name conflicts.

Character Name Conflict Rules

-   Players that have logged into their character during the ninety (90)
    day period immediately preceding the server merge will have priority
    to the character name.
-   If both players have logged into their character during the
    ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge,
    priority goes to the player that created the character name first.
-   If neither player has logged into their character during the
    ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge,
    priority still goes to the player that created the character name
    first.
-   Characters that are deemed to have the lower priority duplicate name
    based on the rules described above will have a "-M" (for Markov
    characters) or an "-E" (for Emerald characters) added to the end of
    their name.
-   Any player that receives the "-M" or "-E" to the end of their
    character name will be able to change their name by using the
    following command in game: /rename <new name>
-   There is no deadline for name change completion, but once a name is
    changed it cannot be changed again.

Example of a Name Conflict: If "Thom" from Markov was created before
"Thom" from Emerald, then "Thom" from Markov would remain the same and
"Thom" from Emerald would become "Thom-E" on Gemini.

Outfit Name Conflict Rules

Duplicated Outfit Names will change similar to duplicated Character
Names.

-   Priority will be given to the Outfit name created first. The Outfit
    name created second will be deemed the duplicate name.
-   Outfit Names that are deemed to have the duplicate Outfit Name will
    have a "-M" (for Markov Outfits) or an "-E" (for Emerald Outfits)
    added to the end of their Outfit Name.
-   Outfits with a duplicate name containing the "-M" or "-E" suffix,
    will be allowed to change their Outfit Name. Outfit Leaders will be
    permitted to change the Outfit Name while in game with the command:
    /outfitrename <new name>
-   There is no deadline for name change completion, but once a name is
    changed it cannot be changed again.

Thank you for your patronage to the PlanetSide community. The server
merge will help to keep the battlefield rich with excitement as we head
into the next year of adventure.

Additional FAQ

-   When will the Markov and Emerald Servers be merged together?
    -   May 20, 2008
-   Which PlanetSide servers are being merged?
    -   The two North American Servers, Markov and Emerald.
-   What is the name of the new server formed from the merge of the
    Markov and Emerald Servers?
    -   Gemini
-   In the event of a character name conflict, which character will be
    given priority?
    -   Players that have logged into their characters during the
        ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge
        will be given priority to keep their character name.
    -   However, if both characters have logged into game during the
        ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge,
        then the character created first will keep the name and the
        character created second will be appended the applicable suffix
        to represent each server as follows: "-M" for Markov and "-E"
        for Emerald.
    -   Additionally, if neither character has logged into game during
        the ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server
        merge, then the character created first will be given priority
        over the character created second and will be given the
        appropriate suffix: "-M" for Markov and "-E" for Emerald.
-   Will I have a better chance to keep my character name if I have
    logged into my character recently?
    -   You will have a greater chance to keep your character name if
        the player on the other server that is about to be merged with
        your server has not logged into that character during the
        ninety (90) day period immediately preceding the server merge.
    -   Priority to keep the character name will be given to the
        character that was created first. The only exception to this
        rule is if one of the two players has not logged into that
        character during the ninety (90) day period immediately
        preceding the server merge.
-   If I have a duplicate character name, how can I change the name?
    -   Players can use the /rename <new name> command to change their
        name. Naming policies still apply for this rename process.
-   Only character names that experienced a Naming Conflict during the
    server merge will be able to rename their character. No other
    character renames will be permitted.
-   What happens if there are two Outfits with the same name?
    -   The Outfit that created the name first will be given priority
        and will keep their name. The second Outfit will be given the
        appropriate suffix: "-M" for Markov and "-E" for Emerald.
-   Can Outfit names be changed after the merge?
    -   Only Outfits that were appended with a "-M" for Markov or an
        "-E" for Emerald will be able to change their name. The Outfit
        leader will be permitted to use the following command to change
        the Outfit name: /outfitrename <new name>
-   If you have more than eight characters on Emerald and Markov
    combined, you will still be able to access all characters on the new
    server, Gemini.
    -   Up to sixteen characters can be accessed on Gemini after the
        servers have been merged.
    -   After the servers have been merged, you will not be permitted to
        create characters if you have eight or more characters on the
        Gemini server. Therefore, if you have sixteen characters after
        the merge, you will be able to delete characters down (to 15,
        14, etc...) but you will not be able to create additional
        characters if you have eight or more.
-   Character Statistics on MyPlanetSide may not immediately report
    correct statistics after the server merge. We will work diligently
    to correct those issues as soon as reasonably practicable.
-   Reserve, Trial and Rental Accounts that did not convert to a
    fully-paid and entitled subscription prior to March 31, 2007 will
    have all characters on such accounts deleted, will not be eligible
    to have characters moved to the Gemini server as part of the server
    merge and will no longer have access to characters on those accounts
    after the server merge (May 20, 2008 )
