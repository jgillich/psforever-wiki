**Incentives** are bonuses awarded to an underpopulated empire and
include a percentage increase in [Experience
Points](Experience_Points "wikilink") awarded for kills and reduction in
spawn timers and vehicle acquisition timers.

Incentives are applied in two different scales:

-   [Empire Incentives](Empire_Incentives "wikilink") (Planetary
    (Continent/Cavern) scale)
-   [Global Incentives](Global_Incentives "wikilink") (Universal scale)
