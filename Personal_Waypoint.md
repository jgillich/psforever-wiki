![](Personal_waypoint.jpg "fig:Personal_waypoint.jpg") [Gun
tower](Gun_tower "wikilink") \]\] Players can set a single Personal
Waypoint on the [Continental Map](Continental_Map "wikilink") to aid
with navigation.

In map mode, <b>right-click</b> on the location to which you want the
waypoint to be set. A white triangular arrow icon will appear at that
spot. On closing the map, a white column of light will now be visible on
the horizon, its base located at the spot indicate on the map. If you
use [Instant Action](Instant_Action "wikilink"), your personal waypoint
will be set close to the [hotspot](hotspot "wikilink") you are meant to
respond to.

To clear it, right click again on the triangle on the Continental Map.
To set another waypoint, right click at a new location. While only one
Personal Waypoint may exist at a time, it may be reused as often as you
like.

Only you can see this white column. For squad co-ordination, Squad
[Waypoints](Waypoint "wikilink"), or a [Laze
Pointer](Laze_Pointer "wikilink") must be used.

(Note: Some players, particularly [Bolt Driver](Bolt_Driver "wikilink")
users, can find these columns extremely distracting. For best results,
place the waypoint a little 'behind' the target area, to prevent it
blocking line of sight.)
