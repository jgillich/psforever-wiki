Version 3.2.12 (January 19, 2005)

-   [Battle Rank](Battle_Rank "wikilink") 23 Extension Players are now
    able to advance to Battle Rank 23. We are also implementing the
    following adjustment to help with the new range of advancement.

<!-- -->

-   Recertification To facilitate existing characters restructuring
    their character build with these changes and to prepare for their
    continued advancement, we will be clearing everyone's certifications
    with this update.

<!-- -->

-   More 1 cert options: In order to facilitate easier travel,
    especially while wearing [Reinforced
    Exo-Suit](Reinforced_Exo-Suit "wikilink"), we are making the
    [ATV](ATV "wikilink") and [Harasser](Harasser "wikilink")
    certifications 1 point.

<!-- -->

-   ATV from 2 to 1 cert point. Harasser from 2 to 1 cert point.
    Adjusting Up Combo Certs: In an effort to control "one man army"
    character builds, who can do it all, from happening with the new
    certification alignment, we are bumping up Uni-MAX,
    [BFR](BFR "wikilink") and [Air Cavalry](Air_Cavalry "wikilink").

<!-- -->

-   BFR will move from 3 to 4 cert points. Uni-MAX combo cert moves from
    5 to 6 cert points. Air Cavalry combo cert moves from 4 to 5 cert
    points.
