**Phoenix**

The **Phoenix** is the [Anti-Vehicular](Anti-Vehicular "wikilink")
weapon for the [New Conglomerate](New_Conglomerate "wikilink"). In its
primary mode, a camera in the nose of the rocket allows the operator to
guide it to a precise target without the operator needing to see the
target from his position. The warhead can be manually detonated at any
time in the flight path by pressing the fire key a second time. The
rocket is cumbersome to steer and has a limited range, usually requiring
the operator to fire in the general direction of his target in order to
ascertain he will be able to adjust the rocket's flightpath in time for
impact. Also, the weapon cannot be reloaded while a rocket is being
camera guided. The operator is unaware of his surroundings while
piloting the **Phoenix**, making him susceptible to nearby enemy troops.

In secondary mode, the **Phoenix** fires an unguided, or "dumbfire,"
rocket, similar to the [Decimator](Decimator "wikilink"). This is useful
when the target is visible and stationary or in close proximity to the
[Phoenix](Phoenix "wikilink") user.
