Plants](Technology_Plant "wikilink") feature **Vehicle Bays**. The
Vehicle Bay is in the basement, and is a large room with a [Vehicle
Terminal](Vehicle_Terminal "wikilink"). Only [Ground
Vehicles](:category:Ground_Vehicles "wikilink") can be purchased there.

Once a [vehicle](vehicle "wikilink") is created it is
[auto-driven](auto-drive "wikilink") through a tunnel into the
[Courtyard](Courtyard "wikilink").

There are 4 doors that lead to the Vehicle Bay: 2 that lead to the main
staircase area, 1 that leads to the [Back Door](Back_Door "wikilink")
area, and the Vehicle Bay outer doors.
