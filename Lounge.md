![](TRLounge.jpg "fig:TRLounge.jpg") Lounge\]\] Sometimes called the
Kitchen, this room is typically adjacent to the [respawn
room](respawn_room "wikilink") in a [facility](facilities "wikilink").

The lounge contains a dining table, food storage unit, a sink, cabinets,
sofa, entertainment center, and a holographic tactical situation table.

Stairs lead down from this room to the [Barracks](Barracks "wikilink")
below and from there to the basement.

It should be noted that [Bio Laboratories](Bio_Laboratory "wikilink") do
not have lounges or barracks. Instead they have a special research area
with [lockers](lockers "wikilink") and a [Medical
Terminal](Medical_Terminal "wikilink"). Stairs lead down from this lab
to a creepy storage facility where players will find the bodies of those
who have offended the Planetside Developers and are hung suspended in a
viscous fluid, floating lifelessly until game world ends.
